Description: RAID 1 over tcp/ip for Linux kernel module
 Drbd is a block device which is designed to build high availability
 clusters by providing a virtual shared device which keeps disks in nodes
 synchronised using TCP/IP. This simulates RAID 1 but avoiding the
 use of uncommon hardware (shared SCSI buses or Fibre Channel).
 It is currently limited to fail-over HA clusters.
 .
 This package contains the DRBD kernel module for the kernel version
 KVERSION
 .
 If you want to build DRBD against your another kernel, install the
 drbd-source package and use module-assistant to create a new
 module package.
