Description: UCS - Linux kernel (standard)
 This meta-package depends on the latest UCS kernel image. It supports up to
 64 GB RAM on 32 bit CPUs and up to 128 TB memory on 64 bit CPUs.
 .
 This kernel is also suitable for operation with Xen (both Dom0 and DomU).
 .
 It is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS), an
 integrated, directory driven solution for managing
 corporate environments. For more information about UCS,

Description: UCS - Linux kernel (for old systems)
 This meta-package depends on the latest UCS kernel image compatible
 with older 32 bit CPUs. The standard kernel in UCS for i386 requires
 PAE, which is not available on 486/Pentium CPUs.
 .
 This kernel should only be used if your system does not support
 PAE.
