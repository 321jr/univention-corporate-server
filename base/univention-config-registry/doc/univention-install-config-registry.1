.SH NAME
univention\-install\-config\-registry \- install UCR template files into package build directories

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B univention\-install\-config\-registry

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B univention\-install\-config\-registry
is a debhelper like programm that is responsible for installing template files using univention config registry (UCR) variables into
.I etc/univention/templates/
in the package build directory. The templates references by
.I debian/PACKAGE.univention\-config\-registry
are installed.

.SH EXAMPLES
A
.I univention\-config\-registry
file has the following formats:
.SS Single file
Each time one of the listed UCR variables gets changed, the File will be re-created.
.RS 5
.nf
\fBType: file\fP
\fBFile:\fP \fIetc/file_name\fP
\fBVariables:\fP \fIvariable_name\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBPreinst:\fP \fIname_of_module_in_/etc/univention/templates/modules/\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBPostinst:\fP \fIname_of_module_in_/etc/univention/templates/modules/\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBUser:\fP \fIuser_name\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBGroup:\fP \fIgroup_name\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBMode:\fP \fIoctal_file_mode\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBEncode-utf8:\fP \fBtrue\fP|\fByes\fP [OPTIONAL]

.P
The template file is scanned for variable substitutions using the \fB@%@\fP\fIvariable\fP\fB@%@\fP syntax, which are automatically registered with this entry.
Additional variables can be explicitly registered using the \fBVariables\fP statement, one variable per statement.
.P
If \fBPreinst\fP und \fBPostinst\fP are used, the module must implement the following Python functions:
.RS 5
.nf
def preinst(config_registry, changes):
    """Called before the update.
    'config_registry' is an instance of univention.config_registry.ConfigRegistry, which contains the updated values.
    'changes' is a dictionary mapping the name of changed variables to a 2-tuple (old-value, new-value).
    """

def postinst(config_registry, changes):
    """Called after the update.
    'config_registry' is an instance of univention.config_registry.ConfigRegistry, which contains the updated values.
    'changes' is a dictionary mapping the name of changed variables to a 2-tuple (old-value, new-value).
    """
.fi
.RE
.P
If a script \fI/etc/univention/templates/scripts/$full_path_to_file\fP exists, it will be called after the file has been created from the template.
The script is called with the argument \fBpostinst\fP and receives the list of changes as \fIkey\fP\fB@%@\fP\fIold_value\fP\fB@%@\fP\fInew_value\fP on standard input.

.SS Multi file
Each time one of the listed UCR variables gets changed, the Multifile will be re-created by concatenating the Subfiles in order.
.RS 5
.nf
\fBType: multifile\fP
\fBMultifile:\fP \fIetc/name_of_aggregating_file\fP
\fBVariables:\fP \fIvariable_name\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBUser:\fP \fIuser_name\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBGroup:\fP \fIgroup_name\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBMode:\fP \fIoctal_file_mode\fP [OPTIONAL]
\fBEncode-utf8:\fP \fBtrue\fP|\fByes\fP [OPTIONAL]

\fBType: subfile\fP
\fBMultifile:\fP \fIetc/name_of_aggregating_file\fP
\fBSubfile:\fP \fIetc/00name_of_partial_file\fP
.fi
.RE
.P
The sub-template files are scanned for variable substitutions using the \fB@%@\fP\fIvariable\fP\fB@%@\fP syntax, which are automatically registered with the multifile entry.
Additional variables can be explicitly registered using the \fBVariables\fP statement, one variable per statement.

.SS Script file
Each time one of the listed UCR variables gets changed, the script will be executed with the argument \fBgenerate\fP.
.RS 5
.nf
\fBType: script\fP
\fBScript:\fP \fIname_of_executable_in_/etc/univention/templates/scripts/\fP
\fBVariables:\fP \fIvariable_name\fP

Variables to trigger the script must be explicitly registered using the \fBVariables\fP statement, one variable per statement.

.SS Module
Each time one of the listed UCR variables gets changed, the Python module will be executed.
.RS 5
.nf
\fBType: module\fP

.SH NOTES
Note that this command is not idempotent.
.BR dh_prep (1)
should be called between invocations of this command.
Otherwise, it may cause multiple instances of the same text to be added to maintainer scripts.

.SH BUGS
File names must not start with the leading slash, they should be relative to \fI/\fP.
