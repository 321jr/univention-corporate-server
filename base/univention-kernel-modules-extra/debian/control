Description: Squash filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.18 on Alpha
 This package provides the Squash filesystem modules for the Linux kernel
 version 2.6.18 on Alpha machines.
 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 Drbd is a block device which is designed to build high availability
 clusters by providing a virtual shared device which keeps disks in nodes
 synchronised using TCP/IP. This simulates RAID 1 but avoiding the use of
 uncommon hardware (shared SCSI buses or Fibre Channel). It is currently
 limited to fail-over HA clusters.

Description: Squash filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.18 on PPro/Celeron/PII/PIII/P4
 This package provides the Squash filesystem modules for the Linux kernel
 version 2.6.18 on Pentium Pro/Celeron/Pentium II/Pentium III/Pentium 4

 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

Description: Squash filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.18 on SGI IP32
 This package provides the Squash filesystem modules for the Linux kernel
 version 2.6.18 on SGI IP32 (O2) machines.
 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.

 Drbd is a block device which is designed to build high availability
 clusters by providing a virtual shared device which keeps disks in nodes
 synchronised using TCP/IP. This simulates RAID 1 but avoiding the use of
 uncommon hardware (shared SCSI buses or Fibre Channel). It is currently
 limited to fail-over HA clusters.
 .
 This package contains the source code for the drbd kernel module.

Package: squashfs-modules-2.6.18-4-sparc64-smp
Architecture: sparc
Section: admin
Priority: optional
Depends: linux-modules-2.6.18-4-sparc64-smp
Description: Squash filesystem modules for Linux 2.6.18 on multiprocessor 64-bit UltraSPARC
 This package provides the Squash filesystem modules for the Linux kernel
 version 2.6.18 on multiprocessor 64-bit UltraSPARC machines.
 .
 Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.  It uses
 zlib compression to compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes
 in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data
 overhead.  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of
 64K.
 .
 Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
 use (i.e.  in cases where a .tar.gz  file may be used), and in constrained
 block device/memory systems (e.g.  embedded systems) where low overhead is
 needed.
