<h1>UCS initial configuration</h1>
<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>The UCS initial configuration will guide you through the configuration steps required to use this newly created system.</p>
<p>The process includes all necessary settings to join the system to a domain or to create a new one. Moreover, additional settings, such as software equipment, may be adjusted.</p>
<br>
<p>The initial configuration is divided into the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the system is not part of a domain yet, the <i>system role</i> may be changed.</li>
<li><i>Language settings</i> incorporate all language relevant configurations, such as time zone, keyboard layout, and system locales.</li>
<li>The <i>basic settings</i> define essential properties, such as host and domain name, LDAP base, Windows domain name as well as the system administrators (root) password.</li>
<li>In the <i>network settings</i>, IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) as well as name servers, gateways, and HTTP proxies may be specified.</li>
<li>Following the <i>certificate settings</i>, a new root certificate will be created for the domain. Note that this step only applies to systems with the role 'domaincontroller master'</li>
<li>Via the <i>software settings</i>, particular software components may be installed or removed.</li>
</ol>
<p>During the saving process, a domain join will be executed, as well.
For this, it is necessary to enter a valid domain administrator account on all system roles except domaincontroller master, where a new domain will be created.
After the successful domain join, the configuration wizard may be closed in order to continue with the boot process.</p>
<p>The configuration can also be conducted via a web browser from an external system. In this case, a subsequent relogin at Univention Management Console will be necessary.</p>
<p>The initial configuration can be modified at any later point via the UMC module "Basic settings".</p>
