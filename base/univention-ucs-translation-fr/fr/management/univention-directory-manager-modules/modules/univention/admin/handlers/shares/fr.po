"Oplocks are the way that Samba clients get permission from a server to "

"the client may even cache file open/close operations. This can give enormous"
" performance benefits. When you activate this parameter, Samba will always "
"grant oplock requests no matter how many clients are using the file. It is "
"generally much better to use the real oplocks support rather than this "
"parameter. If you enable this option on all read-only shares or shares that "
"you know will only be accessed from one client at a time such as physically "
"read-only media like CDROMs, you will see a big performance improvement on "
"many operations. If you enable this option on shares where multiple clients "

"This value controls the handling of file locking in the server. If strict "
"locking is set to Auto (the default), the server performs file lock checks "
"only on non-oplocked files. As most Windows redirectors perform file locking"
" checks locally on oplocked files this is a good trade-off for improved "
"performance. If set to yes, the server will check every read and write "
"access for file locks, and deny access if locks exist. This can be slow on "
"some systems. If strict locking is disabled, the server performs file lock "
"checks only if the client explicitly asks for them."
