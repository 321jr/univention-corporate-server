Fuse version 0.01
=================

This is a test release.  It seems to work thus far, but still has a few
iffy areas, as well as a few rough edges.  There will be future
releases.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test  # currently this just makes sure the lib can link
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the FUSE userspace library and the FUSE kernel module.

BUGS

Currently theres a huge problem with atomicity - putting an md5sum or something
in a while loop, and cd'ing into the mountpoint from a different directory
causes some interesting failures.  For normal perl, every call should grab a
global lock.  For thread-perl, I'm gonna have to do some research to figure out
the best solution.

Quite a few things aren't tested.

The tested (and seemingly working) stuff includes:
getattr
readlink
getdir
mknod
mkdir
unlink
rmdir
open
read
statfs

which leaves:
symlink
rename
link
chmod
chown
truncate
utime
write
