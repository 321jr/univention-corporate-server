Description: UCS - LDAP Listener
 Univention LDAP Listener is a client for the Univention
 LDAP Notifier that calls Python handlers on changes. By
 keeping a local cache, it can detect the change of single
 attributes and only run the appropriate handlers, providing
 both, the old and new objects to the handler. Through
 modules, all sort of functionality such as LDAP replication
 or host specific configuration files can be implemented.

 This package is part of Univention Corporate Server (UCS),
