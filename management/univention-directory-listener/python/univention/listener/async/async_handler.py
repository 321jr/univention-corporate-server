class AsyncListenerModuleHandler(ListenerModuleHandler):
	"""
	Asynchronous listener module base class.

	When a listener module is configured with parallelism > 1 the handler code
	will run in multiple processes in parallel. To share variables between the
	processes methods are provided to easily save data to and retrieve it from
	a memcached server.
	set_shared_var() and get_shared_var() can be used to store and retrieve
	data, lock() can be used to prevent race conditions.

	All operations on the same LDAP object will be serialized: `create()`,
	`modify()` and `remove()` will never run in parallel for objects with the
	same `entryUUID` and the execution order of those functions will be
	preserved.Operations on LDAP object with different `entryUUIDs` will run in
	parallel.

	A word of *caution* about `pre_run()` and `post_run()` in asynchronous
	listener modules: If possible their use should be completely avoided. They
	will run in the expected order, but as they might be queued in between
	`create()`, `modify()`, `remove()`, it is possible for those calls to
	follow a `post_run()`. So even if a `pre_run()` will follow a `post_run()`
	before the next c/m/r call, it may not be efficient to tear down network/DB
	connections etc.

	* pre_run() is guaranteed to only run before the first create/modify/
	remove() and after a post_run().
	* post_run() is guaranteed to run as the last function.

	The error_handler() in asynchronous listener must not raise an exception
	itself!
