== Univention Self Service ==
..

=== Packages ===
* univention-management-console-module-passwordreset: UMC module for the
    password reset plugin (to be installed on DC master or backup)
* univention-self-service: frontent base package, requirement for all plugins
    (can be installed on all UCS roles)
* univention-self-service-passwordreset: password reset plugin frontend (can
    be installed on all UCS roles)

=== Plugins ===
To add a new self service, create UMC module (see [1] and umc directory here)
as backend and a Python module for the frontend.

Place the directory with the frontend Python module inside
/usr/share/univention-self-service/plugins/. Its __init__.py must contain a
class that is derived from univention.selfservice.frontend.UniventionSelfServiceFrontend.

=== Password reset black/white lists ===
Blacklists take precedence over whitelists.

A user on a blacklist or in a group in a blacklist cannot use the service
even if it is a whitelisted user or in a whitelisted group.
