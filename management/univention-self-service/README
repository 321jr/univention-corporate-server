== Univention Self Service ==
...

=== Plugins ===
To add a new self service, create UMC module (see [1] and umc directory here)
as backend and a Python module for the frontend.

Place the directory with the frontend Python module inside
/usr/share/univention-self-service/plugins/. Its __init__.py must contain a
class that is derived from univention.selfservice.frontend.UniventionSelfServiceFrontend.
