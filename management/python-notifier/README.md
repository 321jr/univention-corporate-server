## python-notifier
To be notified or to be threaded that is the question! As the package name may suggest, pyNotifier is a notifier/event scheduler abstraction written in python. It implements notification mechanisms for socket events (read or write) and timers. Additionally external event dispatchers may be called during an idle period.
