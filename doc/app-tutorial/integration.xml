	<title>Integration with UCS</title>
	<para>
		Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is not just an enterprise Linux distribution. With its focus
		on identity and infrastructure management it has a lot of information saved about the IT
		infrastructure environment, the user accounts and the groups and the system configuration, to name a
		few.
	</para>

	<para>
		The most obvious integration makes use of the numerous user accounts stored in the UCS directory service. Apps using this information avoid double effort in user administration. They may technically make just a simple LDAP bind for user authentication. Or if the app needs certain user attributes in its own persistence layer (e.g. the database) they may be synchronised via the Listener-/Notifier mechanism.
		Furthermore, existing data can be extended with app specific attributes, e.g., shall a user be allowed to use the app or what role shall the user occupy for the app. The UCS management system can be extended by attributes and the information is usually stored in the directory service. It is even possible that certain values or their change may trigger certain actions.
		A third integration possibility is to hook up the app in existing solution stacks of UCS, for example the mail stack or the web server. The app will among others benefit from a working configuration and a higher communication security because of already present security certificates.
	</para>

	<para>
		Those are just a few examples to outline the possibilities for the integration. There are many
		more. The guiding question for the integration should be: What information about the infrastructure,
		the configuration and identities does UCS offer that the app will benefit of and saves efforts for
		the administrator?
	</para>

	<para>
		The following sections give an impression of several integration scenarios. Further
		information can be found in the UCS developer reference.
	</para>
	<section>
		<title>Read information from the directory service</title>

		<para>
			One primary element of the UCS management system is an LDAP directory in which the data
			required across the domain for the administration are stored. In addition to the user accounts and
			similar elements, the data basis of services such as DHCP is also saved there.
		</para>

		<para>
			An LDAP directory has a tree-like structure, the root of which forms the so-called basis of
			the UCS domain. The UCS domain forms the common security and trust context for its members. An
			account in the LDAP directory establishes the membership in the UCS domain for users. Computers
			receive a computer account when they join the domain.
		</para>

		<para>
			UCS utilises OpenLDAP as a directory service server. The directory is provided by the master
			domain controller and replicated on all domain controllers (DCs) in the domain. The complete LDAP
			directory is also replicated on a DC backup as this can replace the DC master in an emergency. In
			contrast, the replication on DC slaves can be restricted to certain areas of the LDAP directory
			using ACLs (access control lists) in order to realize a selective replication.
		</para>

		<para>
			More information about the OpenLDAP server in UCS can be found in the manual.
		</para>

		<section>
			<title>Access the LDAP directory</title>

		<para>
			Sometimes software can use LDAP, but does not use the user accounts directly but is
			restricted to one specific user who then is used for further user authentication. This LDAP bind can
			be done by creating a app specific user in UDM. This should be done in a Join script via

		<para>
			Now you can configure your software accordingly. Here the DN will be
			uid=$APP-user,cn=users,$ldap_base.
		</para>

		<para>
			If more access is needed, it is also possible to use the machine account of the UCS system.
			Every computer joined into the UCS domain has certain permissions. Computers in
			cn=dc,cn=computers,$ldap_base (by default DC Master, DC Backup, DC Slave) can even access the
			password attributes of users and computers. The password for the machine account is stored in
			/etc/machine.secret (readable by root). The machine DN can be found by

		<para>
			UCS ships with a key-value store used to save parameters of the environment, the Univention
			Config Registry (UCR). It holds information about the local host (like hostname or network settings)
			and to some extent about the domain configuration (like the domainname or where the DC Master can be
			found). More details can be found in the Developer Reference.

			Notable variables include:

			You can use the database to store your own keys and values and use those in your script:

		<programlisting language="sh">
ucr set myapp/loglevel=5
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			It is also possible to set the variable only if it was not set before. This is generally
			preferred as it allows users to overwrite those values without having to fear that it is overwritten
			again.
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
ucr set myapp/loglevel?4
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			You do not need to register those variables anywhere, they are just saved. It is also
			possible to use theses variables in your installations scripts as environment variables, for
			example:
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
eval "$(ucr shell)"
echo "This UCS system has the FQDN $hostname.$domainname and the LDAP \
			base is $ldap_base."
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			A very powerful ability of UCR is its usage in templates. You may ship files that are
			recreated when certain variables change. For example, your app's configuration file needs to be
			updated every time a locale of the system is added or removed. Say your main package (myapp.deb)
			ships /etc/myapp.conf:
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
# configuration of myapp
title=My App
locales=en_US.UTF-8:UTF-8
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			Your integration package (univention-myapp.deb) can ship this file, too:
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
@%@UCRWARNING=#@%@
# configuration of myapp
title=My App
locales=@%@locale@%@
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			This file shall trigger each time
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
ucr set locale=...
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			is called.
		</para>

		<para>
			You need to add the file above in univention-myapp's directory conffiles/etc/myapp.conf.
			Furthermore you need to add the following in debian/rules.
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
override_dh_auto_install:
univention-install-config-registry
dh_auto_install

%:
dh $@
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			Now you need to tell the system when to recreate it. For this create a file
			debian/univention-myapp.univention-config-registry with
		</para>

		<programlisting language="sh">
Type: file
File: etc/myapp.conf
Variables: locale
		</programlisting>

		<para>
			And this should do the trick. Templates can even use a python runtime to do more than just
			writing the exact content of certain UCR variables. See the Reference for details.

		<title>Domain-Join and Unjoin</title>

		<para>
			Integration into the UCS domain works by writing into the domain wide LDAP directory. The package
			can only change something in the LDAP directory through a join script otherwise the functionality is
			not guaranteed. Furthermore, the hostname and other basic configuration settings are first defined
			when the join script is executed.
		</para>

			<para>
				It is highly recommended to use Apache for it is the service with port 80/443. While it is
				possible to just let the app responding to requests on port say, 8080, many firewalls will block the
				app without taking further actions. One prominent example are the default security rules of the
				Amazon Web Services. The app may not be accessible without using Apache as a proxy!

			<title>Setting links to the web interface in /ucs-overview</title>

			<para>
				The start page of any UCS system (http://$hostname/) lists available services on this
				server, notably UMC. If an app provides a web interface, this can be listed, too. The easiest way is
				by stating this in the ini file:
			</para>

			<programlisting language="sh">
WebInterface=/$APP/
#WebInterfaceName=... # defaults to Name=
# one of the two categories in /ucs-overview. "services" (default) or "admin"
#UCSOverviewCategory=services
			</programlisting>

			<para>
				If WebInterface is given in the ini, the App Center takes care of the integration on the
				overview site. But sometimes this is not powerful enough. This level of "automated integration"
				cannot handle ports other than 80/443 (as it will always use the current port which is 80 or 443)
				and cannot add more than one link. If a deeper level is required, this should be done in the
				postinst and postrm scripts of the integration package using UCR:
			</para>

			<title>Using PostgreSQL or MySQL</title>

			<para>
				When your application uses PostgreSQL, your package should depend on univention-postgres and
				you need to ship a file in /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf.d/ or, maybe even better, in
				/etc/univention/templates/files/etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf.d/ (see UCR):
			</para>

				<programlisting language="sh">
local $app_db_name $app_db_user md5
				</programlisting>

			<para>
				When your application uses MySQL, you may access the admin password by reading
				/etc/mysql.secret. A dependency to mysql is enough as we patch the debian package.
