<title>Package the software solution</title>

<section id="package:debian">
	<title>Create or use Debian packages</title>

		<para>
			You as ISV already distribute your software solution in a certain way. Univention App
			Center makes heavy use of the Debian package manager <command>dpkg</command> and the technology around it. Therefore,
			it is required that the software is provided in the Debian package format and that it can be
			installed non-interactively, e.g. the user will not be asked any questions for software
			configuration. This step has to be moved to a later step following the package installation.
		</para>

		<para>
			Please follow this checklist:
		</para>

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>
					If your software is provided via <filename class="extension">.deb</filename> files, you already have Debian packages.
				Please install those packages on UCS for testing purpose and evaluate if the software works as
				expected.
			</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>
				If your software is not provided via <filename class="extension">.deb</filename> files, Debian packages have to be created.
				Please follow the chapter <ulink
				url="https://docs.software-univention.de/developer-reference.html#chap:packaging">packaging
				software</ulink> in the UCS developer reference about how to create Debian packages.
			</simpara></listitem>
		</orderedlist>
</section>

<section id="package:structure">
	<title>Structure the App</title>

		<para>
			In most cases packages of an app for Univention App Center in principle consist of:
		</para>

		<orderedlist>
			<listitem><simpara>
				packages including the vanilla software solution of the ISV
			</simpara></listitem>
			<listitem><simpara>
				packages with the integration of the software solution with Univention Corporate Server
			</simpara></listitem>
		</orderedlist>

		<para>
			For the ease of app maintenance it is recommended to provide the vanilla software from
			1. in packages on their own, independent from UCS. This allows to theoretically use the packages on
			other Debian-based Linux Distributions like for example Debian GNU/Linux itself or Ubuntu.
		</para>

		<para>
			The UCS specific part from 2. should be collected in a separate package. This package
			depends on the "main" package from 1. and therefore automatically installs all the other packages
			needed via the dependency resolution of the package manager.
		</para>
