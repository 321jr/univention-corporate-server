			After you sent the upload-id to Univention, a Univention employee will extract your
			files and copy them to the Test App Center. You'll receive a short note about how to activate the
			Test App Center for final testing of your app. After the app passed the automatic tests at
			Univention concerning the packages and you as vendor gave your written approval, the app will be
			published in the App Center. Due to feedback and further communication the approval process may last
			a couple of days. Further uploads may be necassary to fix issue that have been found during this
