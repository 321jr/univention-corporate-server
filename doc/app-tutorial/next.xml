			After you sent the upload-id to Univention, a Univention employee will extract your
			files and copy them to the Test App Center. You'll receive a short note about how to activate the
			Test App Center for final testing of your app. After the app passed the automatic tests at
			Univention concerning the packages and you as vendor gave your written approval, the app will be
			published in the App Center. Due to feedback and further communication the approval process may last
			a couple of days. Further uploads may be necessary to fix issue that have been found during this
			iterating process.
		</para>
		<note><para>
				The automatic tests run after the packages have been copied into the Test App Center, only cover
				UCS core functionality, e.g., whether LDAP still works after adding a schema file. They do not test
				the App itself.
