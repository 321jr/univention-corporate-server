  <title>Heterogeneous enterprise environment in an insurance company</title>
  <section id="insurance:start">
	<title>Initial situation</title>
	<para>
		<foreignphrase>Hanseatische Marineversicherung</foreignphrase> (<acronym>HMV</acronym>) is an insurance company with
		1800 employees specialised in the logistics sector. <acronym>HMV</acronym> is a subsidiary
	  of the Vigil Insurances parent company.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The parent company operates an independent directory service based on
	  Microsoft Active Directory, but the user data of the individual
	  subsidiaries is managed internally.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The employees work at a total of 36 locations across the world with
	  the largest being the company headquarter in Bremen with approximately
	  250 persons. Many of the users work on the move with laptops as
	  salespersons or estimators.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Microsoft Windows 7 is used on all the desktops. Software distribution
	  and the installation of security updates are centralised.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Citrix XenApp needs to be employed in the headquarters because of a
	  superordinate group policy: users should access the terminal services
	  with thin clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The groupware Microsoft Exchange is provided centrally by the parent
	  company.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All users, computers and services should be centrally
	  administrable. Critical system status should be reported promptly per
	  e-mail and SMS.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All server systems in the headquarters should be virtualized. The
	  resulting considerable significance of virtualization requires the
	  implementation of an open source solution.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Data backup is performed centrally in Bremen.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Different international compliance requirements from the insurance
	  sector must be satisfied.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:impl">
	<title>Implementation</title>
	<para>
	  The company implements an infrastructure composed of a &ucsMaster;
	  (DC master), a &ucsBackup; (DC backup), several UCS &ucsSlave; (DC
	  slaves) and 150 thin clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The DC master is the centrepiece of the UCS domain. The central,
	  writable LDAP directory is provided on this system.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The DC backup also largely represents a copy of the DC master. In this
	  way, the important services are available doubled on the network, the
	  availability of the services is thus further increased and the load is
	  distributed between the domain controllers.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If the DC master fails as a result of a hardware defect, the DC backup
	  can be converted to the DC Master in a very short time.
	</para>

		<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations40/versicherung_en.png"/>
	  </figure>
	</para>

	<para>
	  The DC master and DC backup are both installed at the company headquarters.
	  The locations also contain additional &ucsSlave; systems, which
	  provide Windows domain services, print services and software distribution.
	</para>

  <section id="insurance:virt">
	<title>Virtualization</title>
	<para>
	  All server systems in the HMV environment are virtualized with
	  &ucsUVMM; (UVMM). Only open source software is used.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <figure id="uvmm2">
		<title>Managing virtual machines with UVMM</title>
		<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations40/uvmm_en.png"/>
	  </figure>
	</para>

	<para>
	  Virtualization servers based on UCS member servers (server installations
	  without a local LDAP server) form the basis for the
	  virtualization. Each of these hosts one or more virtual machines with
	  the KVM virtualization solution. UCS and Windows systems are operated
	  paravirtualized, i.e., the direct access of the virtualized systems to the
	  hosts' resources results in better performance.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All virtual machines can be created and managed conveniently over the
	  web-based &ucsUVMM;. If maintenance work is necessary on a
	  virtualization server, the virtual machines running on this system can
	  be migrated to another server while still running.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:software">
	<title>Software distribution of UCS systems</title>
	<para>
	  Installation profiles have been created for the UCS domain
	  controllers. These profiles can be used to roll out new systems with
	  the Univention Net Installer using PXE or, as required, to restore
	  systems after hardware failure. The installation concludes without
	  further user interaction.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A central package installation source - the repository - is
	  established on a server in the headquarters for the installation of
	  release updates and the subsequent installation of software
	  packages. All installable software packages and updates are provided
	  there.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Policies in the &ucsUMC; can be used to control the software
	  distribution centrally. The updates can be installed or software
	  packages can be subsequently installed at a freely selectable time or
	  when shutting down / starting up the system.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All systems record the installed packages in a central SQL database
	  automatically so that an overview of the software inventory is always
	  available. Security updates for UCS are promptly provided to download
	  and can also be installed automatically.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:windows">
	<title>Connecting Windows clients and Windows software deployment</title>
	<para>
	  Samba 4 is used in the HMV for the integration of Microsoft Windows
	  clients. Samba 4 offers domain, directory and authentication services
	  which are compatible with Microsoft Active Directory. These also allow
	  the use of the tools provided by Microsoft for the management of group
	  policies (GPOs).
	</para>

	<para>
	  Windows clients can join the Active Directory-compatible domains
	  provided by UCS directly and can be centrally configured via group
	  policies. From the client point of view, the domain join procedure is
	  identical to joining a Windows-based domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The Open Source software distribution opsi runs on the Windows
	  clients. It allows an extensively automated distribution of security
	  updates and Windows updates as well as the rollout of software
	  packages to the Windows clients. The configuration of opsi integrates
	  itself into the UCS management system with OPSI4UCS.
	</para>

	<para>
	  opsi is also used for the rollout of new Windows systems. These are
	  automatically installed via PXE.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:ad">
	<title>Active Directory synchronisation</title>
	<para>
	  The Univention Active Directory connector (AD connector for short)
	  makes it possible to synchronise directory service objects between a
	  Microsoft Windows 2000/2003/2008/2012 server with Microsoft Active
	  Directory (AD) and an Open Source LDAP directory service in &ucsUCS;.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The synchronisation settings can be specified individually. The
	  administrator thus has the possibility of controlling the
	  synchronisation precisely and only synchronising selected objects and
	  attributes.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The UCS directory service synchronises with the Microsoft Active
	  Directory of the parent company. The replication encompasses
	  all the containers, organisational units, users and groups. Users have
	  a special position since the password cannot be queried via the
	  LDAP protocol in Microsoft Active Directory. A system service is
	  installed on the Windows server for this purpose, which enables
	  password synchronisation.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The computer accounts are not synchronised, as Windows computers can
	  only be joined in one domain. All Windows clients are joined in the UCS
	  Samba 4 domain.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:groupware">
	<title>Groupware</title>
	<para>
	  The groupware is provided in the form of Exchange Server
	  2010 by the parent company Vigil Insurances, allowing the users to
	  access it using Outlook 2010 and Outlook WebAccess.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The integration of the UCS directory service and the Active Directory
	  of the parent company allows authentication with the same user name /
	  password.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Users can access the services of both environments in a transparent
	  way, as the same user settings apply in both domains. For example, a
	  user can log into both the UCS directory service on his laptop and
	  the Citrix Server in the Microsoft Active Directory with the same user
	  name and password.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:complianc3">
	<title>Compliance requirements</title>
	<para>
	  HMV must satisfy a range of insurance industry compliance
	  requirements.
	</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <simpara>All LDAP write accesses must be verifiable. This is
		  done by means of the Univention Directory Logger. This
		  transcribes each LDAP change in a secure transaction log
		  file, which is protocolled audit-compliantly with
		  checksums.</simpara></listitem>

		<listitem><simpara>The user data must be available immediately
		for external audit purposes. To do so, Univention Directory
		Reports can be used to create a PDF document or a CSV file of
		all or some users and groups from the
		&ucsUMC;.</simpara></listitem>

		<listitem><simpara>Quality standards must be established for
		passwords. In UCS, for example, one can set a minimum number
		of lowercase and uppercase characters, symbols or figures for
		passwords. In addition, passwords can be compared against a
		list of unsafe passwords (e.g.,
		<emphasis>secret</emphasis>).</simpara></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:monitoring">
	<title>System monitoring with Nagios</title>
	<para>
	  UCS integrates the system monitoring software Nagios, which allows the
	  monitoring of complex IT structures from networks, computers and
	  services. Nagios includes a comprehensive range of monitoring modules,
	  which can also be expanded if necessary.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The Nagios configuration is predominantly performed in the &ucsUMC;.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A web-based interface can be used to check the status of the monitored
	  objects. In addition, Nagios is configured in such a way that the
	  administrators receive e-mails when errors occur. SMS messages are
	  sent for serious errors.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <figure id="nagios">
		<title>System monitoring of a server</title>
		<graphic scalefit="1" width="100%" fileref="illustrations40/nagios_en.png"/>
	  </figure>
	</para>

	<para>
	  Nagios checks can be chronologically limited so that non-critical
	  values don't trigger logging messages during the night, for example.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:aix">
	<title>Integration of the AIX system</title>
	<para>
	  The insurance policies are administrated with an application which can
	  only be operated on highly available POWER7 systems using IBM AIX.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In the past, all users working on the system were maintained doubly in
	  the local user database of the AIX system. Now only the <systemitem class="service">secldapclntd</systemitem>
	  service runs on the AIX system; it performs all the authentication
	  processes against the UCS LDAP directory.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:terminal">
	<title>Citrix terminal services</title>
	<para>
	  In the headquarters 150 users work with terminal services based on
	  Citrix XenApp. The XenApp terminal server runs on a Windows member server,
	  which joined the local Samba 4 domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Access to the Citrix server is performed via thin clients, which are
	  operated with Univention Corporate Client (UCC): the thin clients are
	  registered and configured in the UCS management system (for example, the
	  IP address can be assigned centrally per DHCP or the monitor
	  resolution can be centrally specified). The terminal services used by
	  the users are configured user-specifically; the configuration is
	  performed via the user administration of the &ucsUMC;.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:backup">
	<title>Backup</title>
	<para>
	  SEP sesam is used for file backup. It offers a distributed backup
	  concept with different backup agents, which backup both complete
	  systems and data. Special backup agents are available for the backup of
	  databases. All data are copied from the standard servers in the
	  headquarters and from there saved on tape media. The installation can be performed with a few clicks
	  using the App Center.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Distributed replicated block device (DRBD) is used for the mirroring
	  of hard drive partitions and other block devices via the network
	  between two servers. In doing so, all local write accesses are
	  additionally transferred to the second server via the
	  network. Depending on the configuration you have the possibility to
	  consider the write access to the hard drive as successful only once
	  this has been run successfully on both the local server and the second
	  server. In this way both servers have an identical copy of a hard
	  drive partition at all times.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="insurance:crm">
	<title>Integration of SugarCRM</title>
	<para>
	  SugarCRM is employed as the CRM solution for sales personnel. The
	  administration of the SugarCRM users and roles integrates directly in
	  the &ucsUMC;. The installation can be performed with a few clicks
	  using the Univention App Center.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The installation is operated as a &ucsSlave; system on the Amazon EC2
	  cloud. This ensures high availability and allows flexible scaling to
	  growing performance and storage requirements.
	</para>
