  <title>Medium-sized mechanical engineering company</title>
  <section id="engineering:start">
	<title>Initial situation</title>
	<para>
	  Ganupa Technologies is one of the leading manufacturers of rolled steel mills. At the company
	  headquarters in Germany, 260 people are employed in Production, Administration, Design and
	  Sales. In addition, there are also local offices in the USA, Argentina and India, each with
	  5-10 employees.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Linux is predominantly used on the desktops. The employees from Design
	  and Development are dependent on Linux software and require a freely
	  configurable desktop.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The employees from Administration and Sales will only be offered an
	  office suite, an e-mail client and a web browser. The desktop should not
	  be able to be modified by these users.
	</para>

	<para>
	  An accounting software required by some users is only available for
	  Microsoft Windows. Part of the design process is performed with a CAD software,
	  which is only available for Oracle Solaris.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The administration of the computers should be as central as
	  possible. Whilst there are two IT technicians in the headquarters,
	  there are no technical personnel at the other three branch offices.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To avoid non-productive times caused by malfunctions, the majority of
	  the offered services must be provided redundantly.
	</para>

	<para>
	  To save energy and minimise maintenance costs, the employees in
	  Administration and Sales will be provided with thin clients (computers
	  without hard drives). As no data or configurations are saved locally,
	  a defective thin client can be easily replaced even by non-technical
	  staff.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A proxy server will buffer the network traffic in a cache and provide
	  virus protection.
	</para>

	<para>
	  A groupware solution is required for the coordination of the globally
	  distributed work procedures.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All user data are centrally saved on an Storage Area Network device (SAN).
	</para>

  <section id="engineering:dc">
	<title>Domain controller / LDAP directory</title>
	<para>
	  The company implements an infrastructure composed of a UCS domain
	  controller master (DC master), a UCS domain controller backup (DC
	  backup), several UCS domain controller slaves (DC slaves) and thin
	  clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The DC master is the centrepiece of the UCS domain. The central,
	  writable copy of the LDAP directory service is maintained on this
	  system.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The DC backup largely represents a copy of the DC master. In this
	  way, the important services are available doubled on the network, the
	  availability of the services is thus further increased and the load is
	  distributed between the UCS domain controllers.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If the DC master fails as a result of a hardware defect, the DC backup
	  can be converted to the DC master in a very short time.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The DC master and DC backup are both installed at the company
	  headquarters. The two UCS systems operate an LDAP server and provide
	  login services for the domains. A DNS and DHCP server maintained with
	  data from the LDAP directory runs on both systems and provides central
	  IP management. A print server is set up on the DC backup.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:virt">
	<title>Virtualization</title>
	<para>
	  All server systems of Ganupa Technologies are virtualized with
	  &ucsUVMM; (UVMM). Only open source software is used.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Virtualization servers based on UCS member servers (UCS servers without a local LDAP server)
	  form the basis for the virtualization. Each of these hosts one or more virtual machines with
	  the KVM virtualization solution. UCS and Microsoft Windows systems are operated
	  paravirtualized, i.e., the direct access of the virtualized systems to the hosts' resources
	  results in better performance. Paravirtualization drivers for KVM are provided by
	  Univention as signed MSI installation packages and, as such, can be installed simply.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <figure id="uvmm">
		<title>Managing virtual machines with UVMM</title>
		<graphic scalefit="1" width="100%" fileref="illustrations40/uvmm_en.png"/>
	  </figure>
	</para>

	<para>
	  All virtual machines can be created and managed conveniently over the
	  web-based &ucsUVMM;. If maintenance work is necessary on a
	  virtualization server, the virtual machines running on this system can
	  be migrated to another server while still running.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Snapshots allow a simple rollback of updates in the case of error.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:ucc">
	<title>Linux terminal services</title>
	<para>
	  Four domain controller slave systems are installed in the company
	  headquarters. They serve as Linux terminal servers, which can be
	  accessed with thin clients.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The users' applications are run on the terminal servers, while the
	  thin clients merely display the applications and transmit the user
	  inputs to the terminal servers. The screen content is provided by the RDP server <application>xrdp</application>,
	  allowing a low-bandwidth access using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
	</para>

	<para>
	  The user data are saved on the central SAN. The share used for this is
	  administrated in the &ucsUMC;.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The Univention Corporate Client with the KDE 4 desktop is used on the Linux
	  terminal servers. All of the applications required for office duties
	  are supplied as standard (word processing, databases, presentations
	  and spreadsheet analysis with LibreOffice, image processing with
	  GIMP, Mozilla Firefox as web browser, Mozilla Thunderbird as groupware and
	  e-mail client, multimedia applications for playing music and videos
	  and burning DVDs/CDs).
	</para>

	<para>
	  <figure id="ucc">
		<title>Centrally managed Univention Corporate Client</title>
		<graphic scalefit="1" width="100%" fileref="illustrations40/ucc.png"/>
	  </figure>
	</para>

	<para>
	  Preconfigured desktops are available for different user groups, in
	  which different applications are preconfigured depending on the duties
	  involved. For example, Administration uses a desktop on which only
	  Mozilla Firefox and LibreOffice are installed, while the
	  technicians have access to a much wider spectrum of
	  applications.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:print">
	<title>Print services</title>
	<para>
	  Print jobs are forwarded to the requested printer via a print
	  server. The print servers are realised with CUPS, which manages the
	  different printers in a central spooling.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In some larger offices several printers are grouped together into a
	  printer group; the users simply print on this group, whereby the print
	  jobs are equally distributed and the next free printer is used. This
	  saves the users from having to check whether a particular printer is
	  already in use.
	</para>

	<para>
	  In addition, every printer is assigned a page price. This allows Accounting
	  to determine the incurred printing costs per user. This can optionally also be
	  connected to a limit on the number of pages which can be printed.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:terminal">
	<title>Microsoft Windows terminal services</title>
	<para>
	  Samba 4 is used to create a Windows domain in which a Microsoft Windows terminal
	  server is joined as a member server. This server is used to run the
	  accounting software, which only functions in Microsoft Windows. The
	  application is displayed seamlessly on Linux desktops via an RDP client.
	</para>

	<para>
	  <figure id="windowsts">
		<title>Integrating a Windows application in the Univention desktop client</title>
		<graphic scalefit="1" width="100%" fileref="illustrations40/windows-ts_en.png"/>
	  </figure>
	</para>

	<para>
	  The Linux and Samba domains use the same user data and users can
	  access their home directories from Linux and Microsoft Windows.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:db">
	<title>Integration of Oracle Solaris systems</title>
	<para>
	  A specialist application for CAD design is only available for
	  Oracle Solaris. The name services on the Solaris system have been adapted to
	  query the UCS LDAP for authentication, i.e. users can log in to the
	  Solaris system with their domain user identification and
	  password. This negates the need for the additional maintenance of
	  local Solaris user accounts.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The Solaris system is assigned its IP address from the UCS DHCP
	  servers via DHCP. The files are saved on the UCS file servers via a
	  NFS share.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:storage">
	<title>Data management</title>
	<para>
	  All user data is stored on a central Storage Area Network (SAN) system. The different shares
	  are registered and administrated in the &ucsUMC;. The
	  Linux and Solaris clients access individual shares via the network
	  file system (NFS), the Windows clients via the CIFS protocol.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:groupware">
	<title>Groupware</title>
	<para>
	  Ganupa Technologies uses the groupware solution Open-Xchange Server
	  Edition for arranging meetings and organising contacts and tasks.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The groupware server is operated as a &ucsSlave; system on the Amazon EC2
	  cloud. This allows flexible scaling of the groupware system to growing
	  performance and storage requirements. The installation can be performed with a few clicks
	  using the App Center.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The administration of the groupware-related attributes integrates
	  seamlessly in the &ucsUMC;. The employees access the groupware via
	  the Open-Xchange web client and Mozilla Thunderbird.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Mobile devices (smartphones and tablets) are integrated via the
	  Microsoft ActiveSync protocol.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Virus detection including signature updates and spam filters are
	  integrated at no additional cost.
	</para>
  </section>

  <section id="engineering:outlook">
	<title>Outlook</title>
	<para>
	  At a later point in time, the plan is to monitor the Internet access
	  centrally via a web proxy. For this purpose, UCS provides an
	  integration of the web proxy Squid and the virus scanner ClamAV.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Alternatively, it is also possible to procure a specialised appliance,
	  which can authenticate the users against the UCS-LDAP server.
	</para>
