	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>
	  &ucsUCS; provides mail services that users can access both via standard mail
	  clients like Mozilla Thunderbird and via the webmail solution Horde.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Postfix is used for sending mails. In the basic installation, a Postfix
	  configuration equipped for local mail delivery is set up on every UCS
	  system. In this case, Postfix only accepts mails from the local server and they
	  can also only be delivered to local system users. If e-mails also need to be
	  sent to external addresses, a mail relay needs to be configured in this
	  scenario (see <xref linkend="mail::serverconfig::relay"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The mail server component can be installed on server roles which realises
	  complete mail transport via SMTP (see
	  <xref linkend="mail::installation"/>). The following functions are only available
	  when the mail server component is used.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Postfix performs a validity test for incoming e-mails in the form of a search
	  in the LDAP directory. That means that e-mails are only accepted for e-mail
	  addresses defined in the LDAP directory or via an alias.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Following the optional spam and virus filtering, the received e-mails are
	  transferred to the Cyrus server for the provision of e-mails via IMAP and
	  POP3. The authentication is performed using the primary e-mail address, i.e.,
	  it must be entered as the user name in mail clients.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Cyrus is preconfigured for the fetching of e-mails via IMAP and POP3. Access
	  via POP3 can be deactivated by setting the &ucsUCRV;
	  <envar>mail/cyrus/pop</envar> to <emphasis>no</emphasis>. The same applies to
	  IMAP and the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/cyrus/imap</envar>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  E-mails to foreign domains are sent directly to the responsible STMP server as
	  standard. The location of the server is performed via the resolution of the MX
	  record in the DNS. Mail sending can also be taken over by a relay host, e.g.,
	  on the Internet provider. This is described in the <xref
	  linkend="mail::serverconfig::relay"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Spam mails are identified via the classification software SpamAssassin and
	  sorted out by filter scripts (see <xref linkend="mail::spam"/>). ClamAV
	  is employed for the identification of viruses and other malware (see
	  <xref linkend="mail::viren"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The UCS mail system does not offer any groupware functions such as shared
	  calendars or invitations to appointments. There are further groupware systems
	  based on UCS, which also offer integration into the UCS management system, for
	  example: Kolab, Zarafa or Open-Xchange. More detailed information can be found
	  on the Univention website <biblioref linkend="univention-technologypartners"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Version 4 of the Horde framework is provided for the web-based provision of
	  e-mails (see <xref linkend="mail::horde"/>)
	</para>
	<para>
	  The management of the user data of the mail server (e.g., e-mail addresses or
	  mailing list) is performed in the &ucsUMC; and is documented in the Chapter
	  <xref linkend="mail::management::general"/>. The configuration of the mail
	  server is performed via &ucsUCR; (see <xref
	  linkend="mail::serverconfig::general"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  The UCS mail system offers the possibility of distributing users across several
	  mail servers. The mail home servers described in the <xref
	  linkend="mail::homeserver"/> are used for this purpose.
	</para>
	<para>
	  As soon as a user in the LDAP directory is assigned a primary e-mail
	  address, a listener module creates an IMAP account on the user's mail home server.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Mail servers are configured using &ucsUCR; (see
	  <xref linkend="mail::serverconfig::general"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  As the name of the mailbox is linked to the primary e-mail address and
	  not the user name, a user can no longer access his old e-mails when
	  changes are made to the primary e-mail address! If another user is
	  assigned a previously used primary e-mail address, he receives access
	  to the old IMAP structure of this mailbox.

	<title>Installation</title>
	<para>
	  The mail server can be set up in the Univention installer by selecting
	  the <emphasis>Mail server (Postfix, Cyrus IMAPd)</emphasis> component. On an
	  already installed system, the installation is performed using
	  the <package>univention-mail-server</package> package.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The package can be installed on all server system roles. The use of a
	  domain controller is recommended because of frequent LDAP accesses.

	<para>
	  The runtime data of the Cyrus server are stored in the

	  <para>
		A mail domain is an common namespace for e-mail addresses, mailing
		lists and IMAP group folders. Postfix differentiates between the
		delivery of e-mails between local and external domains. Delivery to
		mailboxes defined in the LDAP directory is only conducted for e-mail
		address from local domains.

		Several mail domains can be managed with UCS. The managed mail domains
		do not need to be the DNS domains of the server - they can be
		selected at will.
	  </para>
	  <para>
		To ensure that external senders can also send e-mails to members of
		the domain, MX records must be created in the configuration of the
		authoritative name servers, which designate the UCS server as mail
		server for the domain. These DNS adjustments are generally performed
		by an Internet provider.

	<para>
	  Undesirable and unsolicited e-mails are designated as spam. The software
	  SpamAssassin is integrated in UCS for the automatic identification of these
	  e-mails. Spamassassin attempts to identify whether an e-mail is desirable or
	  not based on heuristics concerning its origin, form and content.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Integration occurs via the <package>univention-spamassassin</package>
	  package, which is automatically set up during the installation of the mail
	  server package.
	</para>
	<para>
	  SpamAssassin operates a point system, which uses an increasing number
	  of points to express a high probability of the e-mail being
	  spam. Points are awarded according to different criteria, for example,
	  keywords within the e-mail or incorrect encodings.
	</para>
	<para>
	  In the standard configuration only mails with a size of up to 300 kilobytes
	  are scanned, this can be adjusted using
	  the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/antispam/bodysizelimit</envar>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  E-mails which are classified as spam - because they exceed a certain
	  number of points - are not delivered to the recipient's inbox by
	  Cyrus, but rather in the <emphasis>Spam</emphasis> folder below it.
	  The filtering is performed by a SIEVE script, which is automatically generated when
	  the user is created.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The threshold in these scripts as of which e-mails are declared to be spam can be
	  configured with the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/antispam/requiredhits</envar>.
	  The presetting (5) generally does not need to be adjusted.
	  However, depending on experience in the local environment, this
	  value can also be set lower. This will, however, result in more
	  e-mails being incorrectly designated as spam.
	  Changes to the threshold do not apply to existing users, but the users
	  can change the value themselves in the Horde web client (see
	  <xref linkend="mail::horde::filter"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
	  There is also the possibility of evaluating e-mails with a Bayes
	  classifier. This compares an incoming e-mail with statistical data
	  already gathered from processed e-mails and uses this to adapt it's
	  evaluation to the user's e-mail.
	  The Bayes classification is controlled by the user himself, whereby
	  e-mails not identified as spam can be placed in the <emphasis>Spam</emphasis>
	  subfolder and a selection of legitimate e-mails copied into
	  the <emphasis>Ham</emphasis> subfolder. This folder is evaluated daily and data
	  which have not yet been collected or were previously classified
	  incorrectly are collected in a shared database. This evaluation is
	  activated in the default setting and can be configured with
	  the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/antispam/learndaily</envar>.

	  can be deactivated with the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/antivir</envar>.
	</para>
	<para>
	  All incoming and outgoing e-mails are scanned for viruses. If the
	  scanner recognises a virus, the e-mail is sent to
	  quarantine. That means that the e-mail is stored on the server where
	  it is not accessible to the user. The original recipient receives a
	  message per e-mail stating that this measure has been taken. If
	  necessary, the administrator can restore or delete this from
	  the <filename>/var/lib/amavis/virusmails</filename> directory. Automatic deletion
	  is not performed.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The Amavisd-new software serves as an interface between the mail server and
	  different virus scanners. The free virus scanner ClamAV is included in
	  the package and enters operation immediately after installation. The

	<title>Integration of Fetchmail for retrieving mail from external mailboxes</title>
	<para>
	  Usually, the UCS mail service accepts mails for the users of the UCS domain directly via
	  SMTP. UCS also offers optional integration of the software Fetchmail for fetching emails from
	  external POP3 or IMAP mailboxes.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Fetchmail can be installed via the Univention App Center; simply select the
	  <guimenu>Fetchmail</guimenu> application and then click on <guimenu>Install</guimenu>.
	</para>

	<para>
	  Once the installation is finished, there are additional input fields in the
	  <guimenu>Advanced settings &ar; Remote mail retrieval</guimenu> tab of the user
	  administration which can be used to configure the collection of mails from an external
	  server. The mails are delivered to the inboxes of the respective users (the primary e-mail
	  address must be configured for that).

		The mail is fetched every twenty minutes once at least one e-mail address is configured for
		mail retrieval. After the initial configuration of a user Fetchmail needs to be started in the
		<guimenu>System services</guimenu> module of the &ucsUMC;. In that module the fetching can
		also be disabled (alternatively by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>fetchmail/autostart</envar>

	  <para>
		In the default setting, Postfix creates a direct STMP connection to
		the mail server responsible for the domain when an e-mail is sent to
		a non-local address. This server is determined by querying the MX
		record in the DNS.
	  </para>
	  <para>
		Alternatively, a mail relay server can also be used, i.e., a server
		which receives the mails and takes over their further sending. This
		type of mail relay server can be provided by a superordinate corporate
		headquarters or the Internet provider, for example. To set a relay
		host, it must be entered as a fully qualified domain name(FQDN) in
		the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/relayhost</envar>.
	  </para>
	  <para>
		If authentication is necessary on the relay host for sending,
		the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/relayauth</envar> must be set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> and

	<section id="mail::serverconfig::mailsize">
	  <title>Configuration of the maximum mail size</title>

	  <para>
		The &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/messagesizelimit</envar> can be used to set the maximum
		size in bytes for incoming and outgoing e-mails. Postfix must be restarted after modifying the setting.
		The preset maximum size is 10240000 bytes. If the value is configured to
		<emphasis>0</emphasis> the limit is effectively removed.
		Please note that e-mail attachments are enlarged by approximately a third due to the base64
		encoding.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		If Horde (see <xref linkend="mail::horde"/>) is used, the &ucsUCR; variables
		<envar>php/limit/filesize</envar> and <envar>php/limit/postsize</envar> must also be
		adjusted. The maximum size in megabytes must be entered as the value in both variables. Then

	  <para>
		If the &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/archivefolder</envar> is set to an e-mail address,
		Postfix sends a blind carbon copy of all incoming and outgoing e-mails to
		this address. This results in an archiving of all e-mails. As standard
		the variable is not set. If there is no mailbox for this address, one

	  <para>
		If a number of error situations (e.g., for non-existent users) the

		returned to the sender. When &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/postfix/softbounce</envar> is set
		to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> e-mails are never returned after a bounce, but instead
		are held in the queue. This setting is particularly useful during

	  <para>
		The &ucsUCRV; <envar>mail/cyrus/mailbox/delete</envar> can be used to configure, whether
