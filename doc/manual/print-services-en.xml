	<para>
		&ucsUCS; includes a print system, which can also be used to realise
		complex environments. Printers and printer groups can be created and
		configured conveniently in &ucsUMC;. Extensions for cost
		calculation and page limitation can be installed subsequently using
		the print quota system.
	</para>
	<para>
		The print services are based on <emphasis>CUPS (Common Unix Printing
		System)</emphasis>. <emphasis>CUPS</emphasis> manages print jobs in print queues and
		converts print jobs into the native formats of the connected printers.
		The print queues are also administrated in the &ucsUMC;, see
		<xref linkend="umc:modules:printer"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		All printers set up in CUPS can be directly used by UCS systems and
		are automatically also provided for Windows computers when Samba is
		used.
	</para>
	<para>
		The technical capacities of a printer are specified in so-called PPD
		files. These files include for example whether a printer can print in
		colour, whether duplex printing is possible, whether there are several
		paper trays, which resolutions are supported and which printer control
		languages are supported (e.g., PCL or Postscript).
	</para>
	<para>
		Print jobs are transformed by CUPS with the help of filters into a
		format that the respective printer can interpret, for example into
		Postscript for a Postscript-compatible printer.
	</para>
	<para>
		UCS already includes a wide variety of filters and PPD
		files. Consequently, most printers can be employed without the need to
		install additional drivers. The setting up of additional PPD files is
		described in <xref linkend="print::ppdlisten"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		A printer can either be connected directly to the print server
		locally (e.g., via the USB port or a parallel port) or communicate
		with a printer via remote protocols (e.g., TCP/IP-compatible printers,
		which are connected via IPP or LPD).
	</para>
	<para>
		Network printers with their own IP address should be registered in the
		computer administration of &ucsUMC; as an IP managed client (see
		<xref linkend="systemrollen"/>).
	</para>
	<para>
		CUPS offers the possibility of defining printer groups. The included
		printers are used employed alternating, which allows automatic load
		distribution between neighbouring printers.
	</para>
	<para>
		The print quota system, which can be installed using
		the <package>univention-printquota</package> package, can be used to install an
		expansion for recording incurred printer costs and for limiting the
		number of pages to be printed. The setting and configuration is documented in the extended
		documentation <biblioref linkend="ext-print-doc"/>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Print shares from Windows systems can also be integrated in the CUPS
		print server, see <xref linkend="print::shares"/>.

<title>Installing a print server</title>

		A print server can be set up on all domain controllers and member

		the package, <command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> must be run.

	The configuration of the CUPS print server is performed via settings from the LDAP directory
	service and &ucsUCR;. If the &ucsUCRV; <envar>cups/include/local</envar> is set to
