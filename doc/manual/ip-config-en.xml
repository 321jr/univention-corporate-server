				updated based on the LDAP information and transmitted to the Bind proxy by means of
				a zone transfer.

				Samba 4 provides an Active Directory domain. Active Directory is

				is used, the domain controller in question is switched over to the
				use of the <emphasis>Samba backend</emphasis>.
				The DNS database is maintained in
				Samba's internal LDB database, which Samba updates directly. Bind
				then accesses the Samba DNS data via the DLZ interface.
			  </para>
			</listitem>

		<para>
		  When using the Samba backend, a search is performed in the LDAP for every DNS request.
		  With the OpenLDAP backend, a search is only performed in the directory service if the DNS
		  data has changed. The use of the LDAP backend can thus result in a reduction of the system
		  load on Samba 4 systems.
		</para>
		<para>

	  <para>
		The proxy authentication (and as a result the possible verification of the group

	  	<itemizedlist>
	  	  <listitem><simpara>
			Direct authentication against the LDAP server. This is done by setting the &ucsUCRV;
			<envar>squid/basicauth</envar> to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> and restarting Squid.

	  	  <listitem><simpara>
			Authentication is performed via the NTLM interface. Users logged in on a Windows client
			then do not need to authenticate themselves again when accessing the proxy. NTLM
			authentication is enabled by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/ntlmauth</envar> to
			<emphasis>yes</emphasis> and restarting Squid.
	  	  </simpara></listitem>

	  	  <listitem><simpara>
			Authentication is performed via Kerberos. Users logged in on a Windows client which is a
			member of a Samba 4 domain authenticate themselves on the proxy with the ticket that
			they received when they logged in to the domain. The
			<emphasis>univention-squid-kerberos</emphasis> package must be installed on every proxy
			server for it to be possible to enable Kerberos authentication. Then the &ucsUCRV;
			<envar>squid/krb5auth</envar> must be set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis> and Squid
			restarted.
	  	  </simpara></listitem>
	  	</itemizedlist>
	  </para>

	  <para>
		If NTLM is used an NTLM authentication is performed for every HTTP query as standard. If for example the

		Dansguardian accepts website requests from the network and checks

		It is also possible to scan requested files for viruses. In the

		<para>
		  Direct access to the proxy server Squid is restricted to access from the
		  local host. Users working on the system on which Squid
		  and Dansguardian are installed have the possibility of bypassing the
		  filter functions by accessing Squid directly. The web proxy and
		  Dansguardian should thus only be installed on
		  dedicated systems which users cannot log in to.

	  <para>
		Following the installation of <package>univention-dansguardian</package>, the
		virus scanner and the filter for web contents are activated.
	  </para>
	  <para>
		The filtering of web content and the virus scanner can be activated
		separately. In order to deactivate the content filter, the
		&ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/contentscan</envar> must be set to <emphasis>no</emphasis> and Squid
		restarted. To disable the virus scanner, the
		&ucsUCRV; <envar>squid/virusscan</envar> must be set to <emphasis>no</emphasis>.
		If neither of the two variables is set to <emphasis>yes</emphasis>,
		Dansguardian is not used. After changes to the variables Squid and - if available - Dansguardian
		must be restarted.

	  <title>Definition of content filters for Dansguardian</title>
	  <para>
		Web content can be filtered based on file suffixes, MIME types, websites and individual
		URLs. It is possible to exempt individual computers or users from the filtering.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		The filter function can be configured via the following &ucsUCR; variables. Where several
		values are to be added, these must each be separated by blank spaces. The filtering is
		performed on the basis of group memberships, i.e., different rules can be
		defined per group and as such it is possible to realise different rights when accessing the
		Internet. Which groups are taken into account by Dansguardian can be defined in the
		&ucsUCRV; <envar>dansguardian/groups</envar>.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		It must be noted that the first group in the list plays a special role. All users which
		cannot be assigned to one of the specified groups are assigned to this one, i.e., the
		defined filter rules apply. This group is generally assigned the lowest rights.
	  </para>

	  <para>
		For group changes to take effect, Dansguardian needs to be restarted. This can be done
		either in the <guimenu>System services</guimenu> module of the &ucsUMC; or on the
		commandline using the command
	  </para>
<programlisting language="sh">
/etc/init.d/dansguardian restart
</programlisting>

	  <para>
		For changes to filter rules, it is sufficient to reload the configuration using the
		following command:
	  </para>
<programlisting language="sh">
dansguardian -g

				  This can be used to disable all filter rules for individual computers with the
