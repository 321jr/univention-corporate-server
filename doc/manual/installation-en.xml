<section id="installation:Hard_drive_partitioning">
<title>Hard drive partitioning</title>
<para>
  This menu is used for partitioning the existing hard drives.
</para>

<para>
  As of UCS 3.1, the Univention Installer performs a partitioning in accordance with the GUID
  Partition Table standard (GPT). Earlier UCS versions used a partitioning in accordance with the
  Master Boot Record standard, whereby the partitioning was stored in the first data block of a
  storage device.
</para>

<para>
  The GPT is downwardly compatible with the MBR; the first data block is still stored in MBR format. This
  block is designated as the <emphasis>Protective MBR</emphasis> and contains a single protective
  partition. It prevents, for example, that older partitioning tools damage the GPT data or data
  within the partitions.
</para>

<para>
  It is possible to create up to 127 partitions, which can take on sizes in the zettabyte range.
</para>

<para>
  The <emphasis>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)</emphasis> replaces PC-BIOS on newer
  systems. As of Version 3.1, UCS supports a boot via UEFI in the 64 bit version (amd64).
</para>

<para>
  On systems with a BIOS - in other words systems without UEFI - a BIOS boot partition is necessary
  when using GPT, in which the Grub boot loader can store the majority of its functions.
</para>

<para>
  If the Univention Installer detects an existing master boot record on the system to be installed,
  this can be ignored (the disk is then not taken into account in the GPT partitioning) or the MBR
  partitions converted into GPT partitions.
</para>

<para>
  As of UCS 3.1, the Univention Installer optimises the layout of the data blocks on the disk
  in order to achieve optimal performance on hard drives with 4k sectors or solid-state disks. If an
  existing master boot record is converted into a GPT, the data blocks are not reorganised and as
  such they are possibly not optimally organised. Consequently, preference should be given to a new
  partitioning.
</para>

<para>
  The conversion to a GPT can affect other installed operating systems, especially if they or their
  bootloaders do not support GPT (e.g., Windows 2000, the 32-bit versions of Window XP or older
  Linux versions).
</para>

<para>
  At the first opening of this menu, the installer offers automatic
  partitioning of the system. On confirmation, the installer displays a
  partitioning proposal in which all the existing hard drives are newly
  partitioned and formatted using the Logical Volume Manager (LVM).
</para>
<caution>
	<para>
  All the data stored on these hard drives will be lost during this process!
  Should the proposed partitioning be undesirable, it can be rejected by
  pressing the <keycap>F5</keycap> function key. The disk space of external storage media, such
  as USB sticks and USB hard drives, is also included in the automatic
  partitioning procedure, so these media should be disconnected if necessary.
	</para>
</caution>

<para>
  If the auto-partitioning is used, the following partitions are created on non-UEFI systems:
  <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara>an 8 MB BIOS boot partition</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara>a 512 MB /boot partition</simpara></listitem>

	<listitem><simpara>a / partition with the remaining disk space</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>

  (name, range of a partition, type, formatting, directory in which the
  partition is to be mounted, and size in MB) are displayed in a table.
</para>
<para>
  For creating a new partition, select the <guimenu>free</guimenu> entry of the desired
  drive and select the <mousebutton>F2-Create</mousebutton> button. In the next
  dialogue, enter the directory where the partition is to be mounted (mount
  point), the size of the partition to be created in megabytes, the file system
  which is to be created on the partition, and the type of partition (BIOS boot, EFI, data, swap,
  LVM). If a partition
  is to be created for the swap area, it is not necessary to give the name of a
  directory where the partition is to be mounted. If all settings are made,
  click the <mousebutton>F6-Write partitions</mousebutton> button to confirm and store the settings.

<para>
  If you wish to include a partition from a former installation, or to correct
  settings made during the creation of a new partition, just select the
  appropriate partition and <mousebutton>F3-Edit</mousebutton>. The
  following input can be made: the directory for the partition to be included
  in, the file system, and whether the partition is to be formatted. If the
  <mousebutton>Format</mousebutton> option is selected, all data in this partition will be deleted. The
  size of the partition cannot be changed later.
</para>
<para>
  New partitions, or partitions created during previous installation procedures,
  can be deleted by selecting the partition and then selecting <mousebutton>F4-Delete</mousebutton>.
</para>
<para>
  It is also possible to use the Logical Volume Manager during manual
  partitioning of hard drives. The installer will only support a single LVM media group (volume
  group) which is automatically named <emphasis>vg_ucs</emphasis>. The possibility of creating
  physical and logical LVM media (volumes) will only be available if LVM support
  was activated manually beforehand, or if a physical LVM medium is already
  existing on one of the connected hard drives.
</para>
<para>
  When deleting LVM media (physical volumes), it should be noted that the
  installer will support this procedure only if all existing logical LVM media
  were deleted via the installer beforehand. Otherwise the contents of the
  physical LVM medium have to be manually moved to other physical LVM media via
  the <command>pvmove</command> command, and the physical LVM medium then removed from the LVM
  media group and deleted, via the <command>vgreduce</command>
  and <command>pvremove</command> commands.
</para>
<para>
  The settings for a new partition are not immediately activated. The
  <mousebutton>F5-Reset changes</mousebutton> button (<keycap>F5</keycap> function key) can be used for restoring the
  previous settings. Only if the <mousebutton>F6-Write partitions</mousebutton> button (<keycap>F6</keycap> function key) is
  used, will the new partition table be written to the hard drive.
</para>

  If there is more than one hard drive available, a dialogue is shown in
  which it is possible to select in which partition the bootloader
  should be installed.

			<listitem>
				<simpara>
				Alternatively, the address can also be configured statically by entering
				the <guimenu>IPv6 address</guimenu> and <guimenu>IPv6 prefix</guimenu>. In contrast to
				DHCP, in SLAAC there is no assignment of additional data such as the DNS
				server to be used. There is an additional protocol for this (DHCPv6), which,

			For IPv6, a gateway must be entered in the static configuration; for the

				<simpara>
				An <guimenu>external DNS server</guimenu> is employed for the resolution of

				Internet provider.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				<simpara>
				A <guimenu>domain DNS server</guimenu> is a local name server in the UCS
				domain. This name server only administrates host names and IP addresses
				belonging to the UCS domain. If an address is not found in the local
				inventory, an external DNS server is automatically requested. The DNS data are
				saved in the LDAP directory service, i.e., all domain DNS servers deliver
				identical data.
				</simpara>
			</listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>
			During the installation of a &ucsMaster; only an <guimenu>external
			DNS server</guimenu> is requested, as a domain DNS server is always set up in the scope
			of the installation. This can then be used by the other systems in the
			domain. The <mousebutton>More</mousebutton> button offers the possibility of entering
			multiple name servers.
		</para>
		<para>
			A local DNS server is also set up on the &ucsBackup; and &ucsSlave; system
			roles respectively. Here, you can configure which server should be primarily
			used for the name resolution by entering the <guimenu>Domain DNS Server</guimenu>.
			During installation, the domain DNS server of an already installed system must
			be specified here, e.g., that of the &ucsMaster;.
		</para>
		<para>
			Only a domain DNS server can be entered on &ucsMember;s and base systems.
		</para>
		<para>
			If there are no network cards apart from a virtual network card, no name
			server should be specified in order to avoid longer waiting times during the
			installation. If the name server cannot be reached during the installation,
			this should not be entered in the Univention installer, but instead only
			configured once the installation has been completed. This avoids longer
			timeouts during the installation.
		</para>
		<para>
			During the installation of some of the packages, files such as the
			Adobe Flash plugin, have to be downloaded from external web servers due to legal restrictions. Should
			the UCS system have no direct access to the internet, the URL of an accessible
