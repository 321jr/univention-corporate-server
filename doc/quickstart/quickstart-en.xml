<chapter id="quickstart:intro">
  <title>Introduction</title> 

  <para>
	Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is a server operating system based on Debian with
	integrated management system for the central administration of servers, services, clients,
	desktops and users. 
  </para>
  
  <para>
	This quickstart guide offers a short introduction on how to get started with UCS. Several
	featues of UCS are only mentioned briefly with a reference to further documentation. The
	documention on UCS is available at <ulink url="http://docs.univention.de"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
	The installation DVD can be downloaded from the Univention website at <ulink url="https://www.univention.com/downloads/ucs-download/iso-installation-image/"/>.
	Installation DVDs are available for the amd64 (64-bit) and i386 (32-bit) CPU
	architectures. The installation of the 64 bit version is recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
	Alternatively preinstalled images for VMWare and VirtualBox can be used. These are available for
	download at <ulink
	url="https://www.univention.com/downloads/ucs-download/preinstalled-vm-images/"/>..
  </para>

  <para>
	An ISO DVD image for amd64 with support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface-Standard
	(UEFI) is available besides the default installation DVD. On systems that support only a UEFI
	start, it must be used instead of the default DVD.
  </para>

  <para>
	The system requirements vary considerably depending on the intended purpose and the number of
	users. The minimum requirements for the installation are 512 MB memory and 8 GB hard drive
	space.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="quickstart:installation">
  <title>Installation</title>

  <para>
	The installation is performed via a menu-driven text installer and can be used both
	interactively and completely profile-based <biblioref linkend="ext-doc-inst"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
	The system language, keyboard layout and time zone
	can be selected in accordance with local requirements.
  </para>

  <figure id="quick-systemrole">
	<title>Selecting the system role</title>
	<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/systemrole-en.png"/>
  </figure>
  
  <para>
	The &ucsMaster; is always the first system of a UCS domain, it should be selected as the system role.
	All other system join the UCS domain during
	the installation. An overview of the additional system roles can be found in the UCS manual
	<biblioref linkend="ucs-systemrole"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
	The fully qualified domain name of the &ucsUCS; system under which the
	computer should be accessible in the network should be entered
	under <guimenu>Fully qualified domain name</guimenu> (e.g., mail.example.com).
	A non-public domain name can be chosen here, e.g. <emphasis>company.local</emphasis>.
	(If the system is to be used as mail server the mail domains can be selected independently of
	the domain name). If the UCS system should take over or join an existing Active Directory domain, the
	AD domain name must be used as the domain name (it is displayed in the Windows Control Panel under
	<guimenu>System and Security -> System</guimenu> in the <guimenu>Domain</guimenu> field.
	The <guimenu>LDAP base</guimenu> and the <guimenu>Windows domain</guimenu> are suggested based
	on the complete computer name and only need to be adjusted in exceptional cases.
	The root password must be at least eight characters long and is also set as the password for the
	<emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> user during the installation of the first UCS server
	(&ucsMaster;).
  </para>

  <para>
	An autopartitioning feature can be used during the installation which creates an LVM partion on the first
	hard drive by default.
	If hard drive encryption or software RAID is to be used, the installation must be performed in
	expert mode. This is documented in the extended installation documentation <biblioref
	linkend="ext-doc-inst"/>. When using RAID, a hardware controller is recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
	A valid network configuration should be set during the installation. If, for example, a
	gateway and a name server are specified, but the name server cannot be reached, this may
	result in unnecessary timeouts. In these cases, it makes more sense not to specify a gateway.
	The network configuration can be employed using DHCP, e.g. if UCS is used on a cloud provider
	without a static IP address.
  </para>

  <para>
	The installed software components can be adapted later at any time and subsequently installed
	from the Univention App Center.
  </para>

  <para>
	After confirming the configuration settings the installation is initiated. Once completed, the
	system must be restarted. The further configuration is made using the &ucsUMC; (UMC).
  </para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="quickstart:administration">
  <title>Administration (Univention Management Console)</title>

	<para>
	  The installed UCS system is configured via the web-based &ucsUMC; (reachable at https://server_ip or
	  http://server_ip, HTTPS is recommended) which be reached under <guimenu>System and domain settings</guimenu>.
	  The login to the &ucsUMC; is performed as the  <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> with the
	  password specified for the <emphasis>root</emphasis> user during the installation.
	</para>

	<para>
	  &ucsUMC; (UMC) is the central tool for web-based administration of the UCS domain. UMC
	  supports two basic module types:

	  <itemizedlist>
		<listitem><simpara>
		  <emphasis>Domain modules</emphasis> manage all the data saved in the LDAP directory, e.g.,
		  users, groups or host accounts. All the modifications made here apply to the whole
		  domain and are automatically replicated to all further LDAP servers. Domain modules are
		  only displayed on the &ucsMaster; and &ucsBackup;. All the domain modules can also be
		  controlled with a command line interface, the &ucsUDM; <biblioref linkend="ucs-udm"/>.
		</simpara></listitem>

		<listitem><simpara>
		  <emphasis>System modules</emphasis> allow the configuration or management of an individual
		  system, e.g., the starting or stopping of services or the installation of software from
		  the Univention App Center.
		</simpara></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>
	</para>

	  <title>Modules in the UMC</title>
	  <graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/umc-modules-en.png"/>
	</figure>

	<para>
	  Users, groups, computers, etc., can only be managed on the &ucsMaster; (the first system of
	  the UCS domain). The data are automatically distributed to the other servers in the UCS
	  domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The administration of individual systems (such as updates, software installations and configuration adjustments) are
	  also performed via the &ucsUMC; (or alternatively through command line tools).
	</para>

<chapter id="quickstart:updatesinstall">
  <title>UCS updates / Installing additional software</title>

  <para>
	UCS updates can be installed in the UMC module <guimenu>Software update</guimenu>.
  </para>

  <para>
	Additional software can be installed using the Univention App Center in the Univention
	Management Console:

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><simpara>
		Additional UCS software can be installed/removed using the category <guimenu>UCS

<chapter id="quickstart:ucr">
  <title>Configuration management using Univention Configuration Registry</title>

  <para>
	Univention Configuration Registry is the central tool for managing the local system
	configuration of a UCS system. Settings are specified in a consistent format, the so-called
	Univention Configuration Registry variables. These variables are used to generate the
	configuration files used effectively by the services/programs. Direct editing of the
	configuration files is only needed in exceptional cases.
  </para>
  
  <para>
	&ucsUCR; variables are managed via the &ucsUMC; module <guimenu>Univention Configuration
	Registry</guimenu>. Configuration files are automatically updated when the UCR variables
	registered on them are changed.

<chapter id="quickstart:clients">
  <title>Clients</title>

	<para>
	  In addition to the UCS servers, a UCS domain can also integrate different clients. The
	  following clients are supported:

	  <itemizedlist>
		<listitem><simpara>
		  Windows clients can join an AD-compatible Windows domain provided by the <emphasis>Active
		  Directory compatible domain controller</emphasis> component (implemented using the software Samba).
