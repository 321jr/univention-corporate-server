<chapter id="quickstart:intro">
  <title>Introduction</title> 

  <para>
	Univention Corporate Server (UCS) is a Debian server operating system with
	integrated management system for the central administration of servers, services, clients,
	desktops and users. This quickstart guide offers a short introduction on how to get startet with
	UCS. Detailed descriptions can be found in the UCS manual <biblioref linkend="ucs-handbuch"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
	The installation DVD can be downloaded from the Univention website at <ulink url="http://www.univention.com/download-and-support/ucs-download/"/>.
	Installation DVDs are available for the amd64 (64-bit) and i386 (32-bit) CPU
	architectures. Almost all server hardware purchased in recent years should be 64 bit
	capable. The installation of the 64 bit version is recommended.
  </para>

  <para>
	An ISO DVD image for amd64 with support for the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface-Standard
	(UEFI) is available besides the default installation DVD. On systems that support only a UEFI
	start, it must be used instead of the default DVD.
  </para>

  <para>
	The system requirements vary considerably depending on the intended purpose and the number of
	users. The minimum requirements for the installation are 512 MB memory and 8 GB hard drive
	space.
  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="quickstart:installation">
  <title>Installation</title>

  <para>
	The installation is performed via a menu-driven text installer and can be used both
	interactively and completely profile-based. The system language, keyboard layout and time zone
	can be selected in accordance with local requirements.
  </para>

  <figure id="quick-systemrole">
	<title>Selecting the system role</title>
	<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/systemrole-en.png"/>
  </figure>
  
  <para>
	<guimenu>Domain Controller Master</guimenu> should be selected as the system role. It is always
	the first system of a UCS domain. All changes to the domain data (e.g. users, groups, computer
	accounts etc.) are always made on the &ucsMaster;. All other system join the UCS domain during
	the installation. An overview of the additional system roles can be found in the UCS manual.
  </para>

  <figure id="quick-fqdn">
	<title>Configuration of the basic settings</title>
	<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/domainname-en.png"/>
  </figure>

  <para>
	The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the &ucsUCS; system under which the
	computer should be accessible in the network should be entered
	under <guimenu>Fully qualified domain name</guimenu> (e.g., mail.example.com).
	The <guimenu>LDAP base</guimenu> and the <guimenu>Windows domain</guimenu> are suggested based
	on the complete computer name and only need to be adjusted in exceptional cases.
	The root password must be at least eight characters long and is also set as the password for the
	<emphasis>administrator</emphasis> user during the installation of the first UCS server
	(&ucsMaster;).
  </para>

  <figure id="quick-part">
	<title>Automatic partitioning</title>
	<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/autopart-de.png"/>
  </figure>

  <para>
	Autopartitioning can be used during the installation that creates a LVM partion on the first
	hard drive by default. The use of this option is recommended.
  </para>

  <figure id="quick-network">
	<title>Network configuration</title>
	<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/network-de.png"/>
  </figure>

  <para>
	A valid network configuration should be set during the installation. If, for example, a
	gateway and a name server are specified, but the name server cannot be reached, this may
	result in unnecessary timeouts. In these cases, it makes more sense not to specify a gateway.
  </para>

  <para>
	The installed software components can be adapted later at any time and subsequently installed
	from the Univention App Center.
  </para>

  <figure id="quick-installation">
	<title>Installation</title>
	<graphic scalefit="1" width="80%" fileref="illustrations/installation-en.png"/>
  </figure>

  <para>
	After confirming the configuration settings the installation is initiated. Once completed, the
	system must be restarted. The further configuration is made using the &ucsUMC; (UMC) and
	described in the next chapter.
  </para>

</chapter>

<chapter id="quickstart:administration">
  <title>Administration (Univention Management Console)</title>

	<para>
	  The installed UCS system is configured via the web-based &ucsUMC; (reachable at https://server_ip or
	  http://server_ip). The log in to the &ucsUMC; is performed as the
	  <emphasis>Administrator</emphasis> with the password specified for the
	  <emphasis>root</emphasis> user during the installation.
	</para>

	<figure id="quick-umclogin">
	  <title>Anmeldung an der UMC</title>
	  <graphic scalefit="1" width="40%" fileref="illustrations/umc-login-de.png"/>
	</figure>

	<para>
	  Users, groups, computers, etc., can only be managed on the &ucsMaster; (the first system of
	  the UCS domain). The data are automatically distributed to the other servers in the UCS
	  domain.
	</para>

	<para>
	  The administration of individual systems (such as updates, software installations and configuration adjustments) are
	  also performed via the &ucsUMC; (or alternatively through command line tools).
	</para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="quickstart:updatesinstall">
  <title>UCS updates / Installing additional software</title>

  <para>
	Release or errata updates (security updates and critical bugfixes) can be installed in the UMC
	module <guimenu>Online updates</guimenu>.
  </para>

  <para>
	Additional software can be installed using the Univention App Center in the Univention
	Management Console:

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><simpara>
		Additional UCS software can be installed/removed using the category <guimenu>UCS
		components</guimenu>.
	  </simpara></listitem>

	  <listitem><simpara>
		Third-party software (e.g. various groupware solutions) and UCS-compatible addon products
		(e.g. UCS@school for school deployment can also be installed through the App Center.

  </para>
</chapter>

<chapter id="quickstart:ucr">
  <title>Configuration management using Univention Configuration Registry</title>

  <para>
	Univention Configuration Registry is the central tool for managing the local system
	configuration of a UCS system. Settings are specified in a consistent format, the so-called
	Univention Configuration Registry variables. These variables are used to generate the
	configuration files used effectively by the services/programs. Direct editing of the
	configuration files is only needed in exceptional cases.
  </para>
  
  <para>
	&ucsUCR; variables are managed via the &ucsUMC; module <guimenu>Univention Configuration
	Registry</guimenu>. Configuration files are automatically updated when the UCR variables
	registered on them are changed.
  </para>

	  following clients are supported:

	  <itemizedlist>
		<listitem><simpara>
