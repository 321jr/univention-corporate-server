                &ucsUVMM; normally replaces eth0 with a bridge interface to connect virtual
                machines to a network. This was achieved by two init scripts renaming the physical
                interface eth0 to peth0 and creating a bridge called eth0, into which
                the physical interface was connected.

            <para>
                If you configure your own bridges, bonds or VLANs using the UMC as described
                in <xref linkend="ucs-network"/> you need to deactivate these scripts by
                setting the following UCR variables:
            </para>

            <programlisting language="sh">
# for KVM:
ucr set uvmm/kvm/bridge/autostart=no
# for Xen:
ucr set xen/bridge/interface=none
# After that re-enable the UMC basic setup
ucr unset umc/modules/setup/network/disabled/by
            </programlisting>

            <para>
                The UVMM profiles need to be updated as well, since the name of the network bridge is stored in them.
                The following command updates all profiles currently using interface <literal>eth0</literal> to use the new bridge <literal>br0</literal>.
