<chapter><title>Profile-based installation</title>

<section><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
  In addition to the interactive installation described in the UCS
  manual <biblioref linkend="ucs-handbuch"/>, profile-based installation of UCS is also
  possible. In this method, the settings for the UCS installer are
  specified in a profile file. If all the required settings are included
  in the installation profile, it is possible to perform the
  installation fully unattended. <xref linkend="profile:variables"/>
  describes the structure of the profile file and the variables used in
  it.
</para>
<para>
  Profile-based installations can be performed in two ways:

  <listitem><simpara>Installation from a DVD: The profile settings can then be
  imported from a floppy disk or a USB storage device or alternatively
  stored on the installation DVD. How to perform a profile-based
  installation from a DVD is described in
  <xref linkend="profile:dvdinstaller"/>.
  </simpara></listitem>
  <listitem><simpara>The <emphasis>Univention Net Installer</emphasis> can be used to perform
  network-based installations automatically via PXE. The profile
  settings used are identical. The PXE-based installations are
  documented in <xref linkend="profile:netinstaller"/>.</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section><title>Introduction</title>
<para>
An installation profile is a normal text file which can be edited with
any editor. Installation profiles must be saved in UTF-8.
The settings must be entered in the following format:
</para>
<programlisting>
Variable='Value1 Value2'
</programlisting>
<para>
Multiple values for one variable are separated by blank spaces. Lines
are commented out with #.
</para>
<para>
It is not necessary to write an installation profile from scratch
every time: The settings performed in the Univention Installer in an
interactive installation are saved in
the <filename>/etc/univention/installation_profile</filename> file (with the
exception of the root password). This file can be used as a template for an installation profile.
Note that the partitioning information from that file cannot be reused, is needs to be specified as
documented in  <xref linkend="extinstallation:profilevars:part"/>.

<section><title>Overview of the possible profile variables</title>

<section id="profile:variables:general"><title>Profile variables - General</title>
<para>
The following profile variables are used to control the progress of
the installation. For example, it is possible to include a password
prompt, run programs before and after the installation or allow the
entry of the value for individual variables during the installation.
</para>

<entry>Function</entry>
</row>
</thead>
<tbody>

<row>
<entry>profile_password</entry>
<entry>
Here one can specify the password that
must be entered when the installation profile is used. This is not
a security feature as the password is saved in the profile in plain
text. However, a password can serve as a safe guard mechanism against an
incorrectly selected profile.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>to_check</entry>
<entry>
Here one can specify variables whose values must
be entered or checked at the beginning of the installation. These
variables can be used to install a large number of computers of the
same type with the same profile in cases where only individual
settings such as IP addresses and the computer name are different. If
more than one value is specified, the values are separated by blank
spaces.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>check</entry>
<entry>
If this variable is used, only the variables listed
are requested. Other missing variables are not taken into
account. <varname>check</varname> supports the
parameter <literal>all</literal>. When <literal>check=all</literal> is used, all profile
variables are requested, even those already set (same as interactive
installation). If more than one value is specified, the values are
separated by blank spaces.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>scan</entry>
<entry>
This option provides mechanisms with which the values
of the profile variables can be retrieved dynamically during the
installation. At present, <varname>hostname</varname> is the only profile
variable supported. If <literal>scan=hostname</literal> is entered, the
computer name is procured via the computer's IP address by means of
a name server request during the installation. <varname>scan</varname> supports
the parameter <literal>all</literal>. If <literal>scan=all</literal> is used, all the
profile variables supported by <varname>scan</varname> are imported during the
installation. If more than one value is specified, the values are
separated by blank spaces.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>ignore</entry>
<entry>
The value for the <varname>ignore</varname> option can
include profile variables that are not to be checked. If, for
example, <literal>scan=hostname</literal> is set, <literal>ignore=hostname</literal>
must also be set. <varname>ignore</varname> must also be used if system
settings are to be set using scripts
<varname>preinst_hook</varname>, <varname>postinst_hook</varname>). <varname>ignore</varname>
supports the parameter <literal>all</literal>. If <literal>ignore=all</literal> is used, no profile
variables are requested unless they are specifically set. If more than
one value is specified, the values are separated by blank spaces.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>preinst_hook</entry>
<entry>
Here one can specify scripts which should be
run before the installation. The scripts must be provided in
the <filename class="directory">script/</filename> directory on the installation medium. If more than
one script is entered, they must be separated by blank spaces.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>postinst_hook</entry>
<entry>
Here one can specify scripts which should
be run after the installation. The scripts must be provided in
the <filename class="directory">script/</filename> directory on the installation medium. If more than
one script is entered, they must be separated by blank spaces.
</entry>
</row>

<row>
<entry>auto_reboot</entry>
<entry>
The system is automatically restarted after
the installation if the parameter is set to <literal>true</literal>
or <literal>yes</literal>. This parameter should not be used in network-based
installations as the computer setting <guimenu>(Re-)install on next boot</guimenu>
cannot be unset at the end of the installation. The
installation would start from the beginning again the next time the
system was started.

<section><title>Profile variables - Partitioning</title>

<para>
The configuration of the partition settings can be performed
completely profiled-baseds. Existing partitions can be deleted or
mounted as data partitions without reformatting; new partitions can be
set up in free areas.
</para>
<para>
In contrast to the remaining variables, the profile variables for hard
drive configuration have an extended syntax.
</para>
<para>
<varname>part_delete</varname> causes deletion of
partitions; <varname>lvmlv_delete</varname> can be used to delete logical LVM
media. The profile variable <varname>auto_part</varname> activates the automatic
partitioning.
</para>
<para>
    The profile variable <varname>dev_<replaceable>Number</replaceable></varname> specifies whether and how
the partition should be formatted and where the partition should be
mounted in the file system. The names used for the profile variable
must be furnished with running numbers starting with zero (<varname>dev_0</varname>,
<varname>dev_1</varname>, <varname>dev_2</varname>, ...) The profile variable for the configuration of
the partitions has the most extensive syntax. The entry type, device
file, partition type, partition format, file system, start and end
cylinder of the partition, directory under which the partition should
be mounted and additional options parameters must be specified.
</para>
<para>
The first parameter describes the entry type. A difference is made
here between <literal>PHY</literal> for a physical partition and <literal>LVM</literal> for a
LVM entry. As a second parameter, the device name of the partition
(e.g., <filename class="partition">/dev/sda1</filename>) or the logical LVM medium
(e.g., <filename class="partition">/dev/vg_ucs/log_vol_1</filename>) must be entered.
</para>
<para>
The third parameter describes the partition type. For <literal>PHY</literal>
entries, <literal>0</literal> means primary, <literal>1</literal> means logical and <literal>2</literal>
means extended. For <literal>LVM</literal> entries, only the value <literal>LVMLV</literal>
for a logical LVM medium is currently recognised. The fourth parameter
determines whether the partition is formatted during the installation
(value <literal>1</literal>) or not (value <literal>0</literal>). Extended partitions are
assigned the value <literal>0</literal>. If you do not want to format an existing
partition, alternatively, the parameter <literal>only_mount</literal> can be set
on the third position and <literal>0</literal> can be set in the fourth
position. The fifth parameter describes the file system to be
used. You can choose between <literal>ext2</literal>, <literal>ext3</literal>, <literal>ext4</literal>,
<literal>linux-swap</literal> <literal>None</literal> (for extended partitions and partitions
to which no file system is to be ordered) and <literal>xfs</literal>.
</para>
<para>
Parameters six and seven describe the start and end cylinders of the
partition. If <literal>0</literal> is entered as the end cylinder, the partition
is set from the specified start cylinder to the end of the hard
drive. The start and end points of the partition can also be specified
in kilobytes/1024 bytes (<literal>k</literal> or <literal>K</literal>), megabytes/1048576 bytes (<literal>m</literal> or <literal>M</literal>) and
gigabytes/1073741824 bytes (<literal>g</literal> or <literal>G</literal>).
</para>
<para>
The end can be specified relative to the start point (e.g., `10g
+2g'). Bytes and cylinder specifications can be mixed (e.g., `12g
0' for a partition beginning at 12 gigabytes and ending with the last
cylinder). For an <literal>LVM</literal> entry, the start point should always be
set as 0 and its end point should be set to the required size of the
logical LVM medium.
</para>
<para>
The following provides an example:
</para>
<programlisting>
bootloader_record="/dev/sda"
disks="/dev/sda"
part_delete="all"
lvm_delete="/dev/vg_ucs/*"
dev_1="PHY /dev/sda1 0 1 ext3 0.032256M 106.928128M /boot None"
dev_0="LVM /dev/vg_ucs/rootfs LVMLV 1 ext3 0.0M 4000M / None"
dev_4="LVM /dev/vg_ucs/vol2 LVMLV 1 ext3 0 4000M None None"

dev_2="PHY /dev/sda2 0 1 linux-swap 106.92864M 633.346048M None None"
</programlisting>
<para>
The eighth parameter stands for the mount point. For swap partitions and other
partitions without a mount point <literal>None</literal> should be entered.
</para>
<para>
<literal>lvm</literal> can be entered as the ninth parameter to mark the partition
as a physical LVM medium. In all other cases, <literal>None</literal> should be entered.

<section id="profile:netinstaller"><title>Network-based PXE installations with Univention Net Installer</title>
<para>
Network-based, profile-based installations via PXE are performed with
the Univention Net Installer, which can be set up using
the <package>univention-net-installer</package> package. In addition, a DHCP
server is required. If the DHCP server and the PXE server of the
Univention Net Installer are operated on separate systems, the PXE
server must be assigned via a DHCP boot policy.
</para>
<para>
Univention Net Installer supports both the interactive and profile-based
installation.
</para>
<para>
Univention Net Installer requires a local repository as a package
source (see the software deployment chapter of the UCS manual <biblioref linkend="ucs-handbuch"/>).
The generated profiles are copied into the
<filename>/var/lib/univention-repository/profiles</filename> directory on the
repository server.
</para>

<section><title>Assignment of a computer for automatic installation</title>
<para>
A computer to be installed via Univention Net Installer must firstly
be registered in the computer management of the &ucsUMC;. The
following values must be set as a minimum:

<para>
The name of the installation profile under
<filename class="directory">/var/lib/univention-repository/profiles/</filename> can be

</para>
<para>
Options entered under <guimenu>Additonal start options</guimenu> are
passed on to the kernel in network-based installations, e.g., for the
deactivation of ACPI during system start.
</para>
<para>
A profile-based installation is performed as standard in installations
with the Univention Net Installer. If one wishes to perform an
interactive installation instead, the <guimenu>Interactive
installation</guimenu> option must be activated. If any installation
profile is entered, then it is no longer used.
</para>
<para>
A PXE configuration file is created for every computer object
under <filename class="directory">/var/lib/univention-client-boot/</filename>.
</para>
<para>
It must be verified that the boot order in BIOS of the system to be
installed prefers a PXE network boot over hard disks or CD-ROMs.
</para>
<para>
The next time a restart is performed, the computer boots via PXE and
is installed via the network. If no profile has been specified, a list
of existing profiles is shown at the beginning of the installation for
selection. If the selected profile includes an error, meaning it
can't be loaded, an error message is emitted. It is then possible
to select another profile.
</para>
<para>
User inputs are only required for profile-based installations if a
profile password is specified in the profile or variables with
<varname>to_check</varname> are explicitly entered for requests (see 
<xref linkend="profile:variables:general"/>). If
<varname>to_check</varname> is not used, a request may be given for
essential variables with missing or erroneous values.

<para>
Special &ucsUCR; variables with partitioning information must then be
set. The installer evaluates these later and mounts the corresponding
partitions during the installation.
</para>
<para>
There are three variables for every partition to be mounted:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara><envar>installer/device/<replaceable>NUMBER</replaceable>/name</envar>: the partition's device file,
  for example <filename class="partition">/dev/sda1</filename>, <filename class="partition">/dev/hda1</filename> or
  <filename class="partition">/dev/vg_ucs/rootfs</filename></simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><envar>installer/device/<replaceable>NUMBER</replaceable>/fs</envar>: the partition's file system type,
  e.g. <literal>ext3</literal>, <literal>ext4</literal>,
  <literal>xfs</literal> or <literal>linux-swap</literal></simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><envar>installer/device/<replaceable>NUMBER</replaceable>/mp</envar>: the mount point, e.g.
  <filename>/</filename>. If <literal>None</literal> is specified here, the partition is
  not mounted (e.g. for swap partitions)</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
The <replaceable>NUMBER</replaceable> value at the third position in the variable's name
increases for every device file to be mounted. The information for
three partitions should thus be saved under
<envar>installer/device/0</envar>, <envar>installer/device/1</envar> and
<envar>installer/device/2</envar>. The root partition, in other words the
partition which will later be mounted under <filename>/</filename>, must
always be configured under <envar>installer/device/0</envar>.
</para>
<para>
If e.g. the following partitions have been setup:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
	<listitem><simpara><filename>/dev/sda1</filename> with ext3 on <filename>/</filename></simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><filename>/dev/sda2</filename> swap</simpara></listitem>
	<listitem><simpara><filename>/dev/sda5</filename> with xfs on <filename>/var</filename></simpara></listitem>

<para>
The following &ucsUCR; variables must then be set:
</para>
<programlisting>
# Root partition

<chapter><title>Example for configuring software RAID 1 with LVM</title>

<para>
A RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is used to increase data security and/or data
throughput via the organisation of several hard drives in a logical
drive. RAID is usually setup using a designated hardware RAID controller,
but can also be implemented with a software-based setup.
</para>
<para>
In &ucsUCS;, software RAIDs can be created and managed with the
<command>mdadm</command> program. At least two hard drive partitions
(normally on different hard drives) are combined into one RAID
device. This RAID device can be accessed, formatted and mounted via a
device file like a normal partition.
</para>
<para>
The kernel modules responsible for software RAID (<filename>raid0</filename>,
<filename>raid1</filename>, <filename>raid10</filename> and <filename>raid5</filename>) are included in the
Linux kernel and loaded automatically.
</para>
<para>
Start the installation in expert mode as described in <xref linkend="expertpartitioning"/>. 
In this example it is assumed that two hard disks with identical sizes are present: 
<filename class="partition">/dev/sda</filename> and <filename class="partition">/dev/sdb</filename>.
</para>
<para>
The following commands prepare the hard disks for RAID 1 by setting up 3 partitions. A small
partition to hold the bootloader, a partition for <filename class="partition">/boot</filename> and the rest of the available space
for a LVM which will hold the operating system.
</para>
<programlisting>
parted -s /dev/sda mklabel gpt
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 1 10
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 10 500 
parted -s /dev/sda mkpart primary 500 100% 
parted -s /dev/sda set 1 bios_grub on
parted -s /dev/sda set 2 raid on
parted -s /dev/sda set 3 raid on
</programlisting>
<para>
To prepare the second disk, each of the above commands has to be executed with the
parameter <filename class="partition">/dev/sda</filename> changed to 
<filename class="partition">/dev/sdb</filename>.
</para>
<para>
The next step is to setup the RAID 1 for the <filename class="partition">/boot</filename> partition and the LVM Partition. 
</para>
<programlisting>
mdadm --create --auto=md /dev/md0 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2
mdadm --create --auto=md /dev/md1 --level=1 --raid-devices=2 /dev/sda3 /dev/sdb3
</programlisting>
<para>
After the RAID 1 has been set up the devices have to sync. This takes some time depending on
the disk size. The current status and remaining time
can be checked with <command>cat /proc/mdstat</command>. Only after the devices are synced the
filesystems can be setup.
</para>
<programlisting>
mkfs.ext4 /dev/md0

lvm pvcreate /dev/md1
lvm vgcreate vg_ucs /dev/md1
lvcreate -L2G -n swap vg_ucs
lvcreate -l100%FREE -n rootfs vg_ucs

mkswap /dev/mapper/vg_ucs-swap
mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vg_ucs-rootfs
</programlisting>
<para>
Before continuing the installation the following ucr variables have to be set to inform the installer
about the partition layout.
</para>
<programlisting>
ucr set installer/device/0/fs=ext4
ucr set installer/device/0/mp=/
ucr set installer/device/0/name=/dev/mapper/vg_ucs-rootfs
ucr set installer/device/1/fs=ext4
ucr set installer/device/1/mp=/boot
ucr set installer/device/1/name=/dev/md0
ucr set installer/device/2/fs=linux-swap
ucr set installer/device/2/mp=None
ucr set installer/device/2/name=/dev/mapper/vg_ucs-swap
</programlisting>
<para>
To continue the installation 
<keycombo action="simul"><keycap function="alt">Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo> 
has to be pressed to return to the menu. When asked
where to install the grub bootloader, <filename class="partition">/dev/sda</filename> should be selected.
</para>
<para>
After rebooting, grub has to be installed on all hard disks to ensure that it
can be executed should one drive fail. This is done with the following commands:
</para>
<programlisting>
grub-install /dev/sda
grub-install /dev/sdb
</programlisting>
<para>
The configuration file <filename>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</filename> contains
general settings and a description of the RAID level and the
partitions involved for every RAID.
</para>
<programlisting>
# by default, scan all partitions (/proc/partitions)
DEVICE partitions

# auto-create devices with Debian standard permissions
CREATE owner=root group=disk mode=0660 auto=yes

# instruct the monitoring daemon where to send mail alerts
MAILADDR root

ARRAY /dev/md0 level=raid1 num-devices=2 UUID=96d170c7:aee25771:2bb7a921:880c37fd
</programlisting>
<para>
The RAIDs entered in this file (ARRAY) can be determined with the
<command>mdadm --detail --scan</command> command. The daemon is configured
in the <filename>/etc/default/mdadm</filename> file. The entry of
<literal>AUTOSTART=true</literal> is important here to ensure that the RAIDs are
automatically updated when the computer is started.
</para>
<para>
The software package <command>mdadm</command> automatically detects all RAIDs
during the installation and creates the configuration files
<filename>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</filename> and <filename>/etc/default/mdadm</filename> In
other words, no additional adjustments to the RAID configuration files
are necessary during the installation.
</para>
