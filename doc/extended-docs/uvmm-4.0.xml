		<title>Operating storage pools using iSCSI</title>
		<para>
			iSCSI is a standard for connecting SCSI storage devices via a TCP-based network
			connection. iSCSI makes it possible to use a wide range of professional storage solutions
			for the storage of virtual machines. This documentation describes the connection of an iSCSI
			storage device (also known as a <emphasis>target</emphasis>) as a storage pool for the
			&ucsUVMM;.

			<para>
				UVMM does not yet support the creation of storage pools via the UMC. The creation of
				storage pools is described below.
			</para>

			<para>
				To make an additional storage pool available on a virtualization server, it is necessary
				to create an XML file with a description. The creation of storage pools is documented in
				the virtualization chapter of the UCS manual. Below, a storage pool is defined which
				accesses an iSCSI storage device.

					<listitem><simpara>

				</itemizedlist>
			</para>

			<para>
				In the following example, a storage pool is defined, which mounts the
				<emphasis>iqn.2010-08.local.ucs:sdb</emphasis> iSCSI target from the
				<emphasis>xen6.ucs.local</emphasis> server: 

				<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[

		<host name='xen6.ucs.local' port='3260'/>

	</source>
	<target>
		<path>/dev/disk/by-path</path>
	</target>
</pool>
					]]></programlisting>
			</para>

			<para>
				This description must firstly be saved in a file (for example, in the
				<filename>iscsi-pool.xml</filename> file). For it to be possible to use this storage pool,
				the following commands must be run:

				<programlisting language="sh">
virsh pool-define iscsi-pool.xml
virsh pool-start iscsi
virsh pool-autostart iscsi
				</programlisting>

				The UVMM service will detect the new storage pool automatically after a certain period of
				time. Alternatively, the service can also be restarted once so that this new storage pool
				information is detected immediately:

				<programlisting language="sh">
/etc/init.d/univention-virtual-machine-manager-daemon restart
				</programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="uvmmext:iscsi:use">
			<title>Use of iSCSI storage pools</title>
			<para>
				Hard disks in UVMM can then be used from the storage pool. When doing so, ensure that no
				new images are saved in an iSCSI storage pool and only existing ones are selected. The
				individual LUNs are offered as possible images.
			</para>

			<para>
				If new iSCSI LUNs are set up, the iSCSI storage pool must still be reimported manually at
				present. This can be done using the following command:

				<programlisting language="sh">
virsh pool-refresh "$pool_name"
				</programlisting>

			<title>Switch to QEMU/KVM</title>
			<para>
				When switching from <application>Xen</application> to <application>KVM</application> the drivers for para-virtual block and network devices must be changed.

			<title>Migrating virtual machines between hosts</title>
			<para>
				(Live-)migration also transfers the domain configuration.
				This breaks when the network interface names differ between the source and destination host.
				Because of that it is strongly advised to shut down any virtual machine cleanly and to transfer them as described above.
			</para>
			<para>
				There is a second option available which allows updating virtual machines while they are migrated from a UCS-3 to a UCS-4 host.
				<application>libvirt</application> provides a hook mechanism, which can be used to rewrite the virtual machine configuration on-the-fly for incoming migrations.
				This is fully described in the <ulink url="http://libvirt.org/hooks.html">libvirt hook documentation</ulink>.
			</para>
			<para>
				The following example can be used to convert the network interface name <filename class="devicefile">eth0</filename> to <filename class="devicefile">br0</filename>.
				The following script must be copied to <filename>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu</filename> and be marked as executable using <command>chmod +x</command>:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="sh"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="uvmm-4.0-qemu_hook.sh" parse="text"/></programlisting>
			<para>
				The script uses the <command>xsltproc</command> <abbrev>XSLT</abbrev> command line processor, which is provided by the package <package>xsltproc</package>.
				The corresponding style sheet file must be copies to <filename>/etc/libvirt/hooks/qemu.xsl</filename>, which looks like this:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="xml"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="uvmm-4.0-qemu_hook.xsl" parse="text"/></programlisting>
			<warning>
				<para>
					Migration can only be done in the direction UCS-3 to UCS-4, not the reverse.
					As UCS-4 is using a newer version of <application>libvirt</application>, additional settings are added to the virtual machine configuration, which older versions can't process.
					Make sure to backup the pre-migration configuration using <command>virsh dumpxml "$vm"</command>.
