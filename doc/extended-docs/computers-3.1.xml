                    Bridging is often used with virtualization to connect
                    multiple virtual machines running on a host through one shared
                    physical network interface.

                    VLANs can be used to separate network traffic
                    logically while using only one (or more) physical network
                    interface.

        <para>
            Configuration of bridges, bondings and VLANs is performed through
            &ucsUCR; variables. The following sections provide an example for
            each configuration.
        </para>

        <caution>
            <para>
            Changing the network configuration on a running system is dangerous, since any misconfiguration can make the host unreachable.
            Make sure you can access the host out-of-band in case of errors!
            It is important to set all related &ucsUCRV;s at once, since the interfaces are re-configured after each change unles the &ucsUCRV; <envar>interfaces/restart/auto</envar> is set to <literal>false</literal>.
            </para>
        </caution>

        <para>
            The following examples only configure IPv4, but all examples can be used with IPv6 as well.
        </para>

            <title>Bridging</title>
            <para>
                Bridging allows a physical network interface to be shared by multiple virtual
                machines running on a single host. Instead of using one physical interface for
                each virtual machine and the host itself, all hosts are connected through only
                one (or more) uplink(s), which is then split up virtually just like a physical hub
                or switch would be used to connect multiple downstream hosts to one uplink.
            </para>

            <para>
                Any physical network interface must not have an IP addresses configured and
                must not be started automatically. This can be achieved by setting the
                &ucsUCRV;s <envar>interfaces/<replaceable>$INTERFACENAME</replaceable>/type</envar> to
                <literal>manual</literal> and
                <envar>interfaces/<replaceable>$INTERFACENAME</replaceable>/start</envar> to
                <literal>false</literal>.
            </para>

            <para>
                An IP address can be assigned to the bridge device (<replaceable>br0</replaceable>) instead, which can then be used as
                the primary interface for services on the host itself.
            </para>

            <para>
                The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) prevents bridge loops, i.e. multiple
                network paths from a source to a destination host. If bridging is used
                for virtual machines and the host is an edge node (in other words the
                bridge does not really connect two physical network
                interfaces and is not supposed to forward traffic between those
                networks), STP should be disabled and the so-called <emphasis>forwarding delay</emphasis> (<parameter>bridge_fd</parameter>)
                should be set to 0. This is needed for virtual machines to boot from
                the network via PXE, since otherwise the initial DHCP packets will
                be dropped and won't reach the network.

            <para>
                Bonding allows two (or more) physical network interfaces to be coupled
                to increase network throughput or to improve redundancy in failover scenarios.
                While various modes are supported by the bonding driver, the following
                example only describes an active-backup failover scenario.

            <title>Virtual LANs</title>
            <para>
                Virtual LANs (VLANs) can be used to separate network traffic into
                different virtual networks each representing their own broadcast domain.
                Instead of using multiple physically separated networks, the network
                packets are instead tagged with a VLAN ID, which is used to partition the traffic.
                Valid VLANs are numbered from 1 to 4095. The same VLAN ID must be configured on all switches.
            </para>

            <para>
                A link between two network devices can either transport packets of only a
                single VLAN (which are normally untagged) or can transport packets of multiple
                VLANs (a so-called <emphasis>trunk link</emphasis>), where each packet
                <footnote>
                    <para>
                        Some switches also support mixing tagged with un-tagged packets on a single link, but for sake of simplicity that scenario is not discussed here.
                    </para>
                </footnote>
                is tagged with a VLAN ID.
                Switches are responsible for adding and removing the tags when forwarding between trunk links and links dedicated to only one VLAN.
            </para>

            <para>
                To connect a host to multiple VLANs, the physical interface (ethX) must be connected to a trunk link.
                The physical interface represents the packets as is, that is the interface sees all packets with the tag added.
                For each VLAN <replaceable>Y</replaceable> on the physical interface <replaceable>ethX</replaceable> a virtual interface <replaceable>ethX.Y</replaceable> must be created.
                It handles only the packets belonging to that VLAN and should be configured with an IP address matching that VLAN.
            </para>

            <para>
                The physical interface itself should not have an IP address configured and
                should not be started automatically. This can be achieved by setting the

                Bonding, VLANs and bridging can also be combined.
            </para>

            <para>
                The following example assumes the host is used to run several virtual machines.
                While the host itself is considered trusted, the virtual machines are considered untrusted, since the host administrator has no control over them and cannot guarantee their proper (network) configuration.
            </para>

            <para>
                The host in this example has three physical network interfaces:
                One interface (eth2) is dedicated to the host itself and is the only interface with a IP address configured on the host.
                The other two interfaces (eth0, eth1) are used to connect the virtual machines to the VLANs 2 and 3. These physical interfaces use bonding (bond0) to provide high availability.
                For each VLAN (2 and 3) a bridge is created on the host, to which the virtual machines are selectively connected to get access to the corresponding VLAN.
                This ensures that the virtual machines only see that traffic and cannot use the VLAN tools themselves to access other (prohibited) VLANs.
            </para>

            <para>
                The interfaces must be ordered bottom-up, because otherwise the interfaces can not be brought up or down automatically.

                &ucsUVMM; normally replaces eth0 with a bridge interface to connect virtual
                machines to a network. This was achieved by two init scripts renaming the physical
                interface eth0 to peth0 and creating a bridge called eth0, into which
                the physical interface was connected.

                If you configure your own bridges, bonds or VLANs using the &ucsUCR;
                variables described above you need to deactivate these scripts by
                setting the following UCR variables:
            </para>

            <programlisting language="sh">
# for KVM:
ucr set uvmm/kvm/bridge/autostart=no
# for Xen:
ucr set xen/bridge/interface=none
            </programlisting>

            <para>
                The UVMM profiles need to be updated as well, since the name of the network bridge is stored in them.
                The following command updates all profiles currently using interface <literal>eth0</literal> to use the new bridge <literal>br0</literal>.
            </para>
            <programlisting language="sh">
udm uvmm/profile list --filter interface=eth0 |
	sed -ne 's/^DN: //p' |
	xargs -r -n 1 -d '\n' udm uvmm/profile modify --set interface=br0 --dn

            <title>Troubleshooting</title>
            <para>
                The name of an interface depends on the loading order of kernel modules and
                on the timing the hardware needs to reach an active
                state. <command>udev</command> tries to assign persistent names to the
                interfaces based on their MAC address. The status is stored in
                <filename>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</filename>.
                If interfaces get removed or replaced by other interfaces with a
                different MAC address, old named won't get reused until that file is reset.
