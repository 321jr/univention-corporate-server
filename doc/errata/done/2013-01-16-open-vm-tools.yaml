fix: 2:8.8.0+2012.05.21-724730-1+nmu2.2.201301160904
note:
desc: |
 This is a backport of the newer version of the Open VMware tools,
 which is compatible with the Linux 3.2 kernel shipped with UCS 3.1.

 Please note that this is a major update of the package from version
 8.4 to 8.8, which changes the build mechanism for the Linux kernel
 modules from using module-assistant to DKMS: instead of installing
 the package 'open-vm-source' and invoking m-a by hand, it is now
 sufficient to install 'open-vm-dkms' and 'univention-kernel-headers'.
 This will automatically compile the modules for the current and all
 future kernel versions on the local host.

 This package is provided in the unmaintained section of the 
 repository and thus requires the UCR setting 
 repository/online/unmaintained=yes.
