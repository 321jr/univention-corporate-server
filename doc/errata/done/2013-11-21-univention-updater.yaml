  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * If a component is blocking a release update and this component is from the
    App Center, link to the App Center instead of showing a cryptic error
    message
  * Fixed the error handling in case the UMC server is restarted during an
    update
  * The updater now uses the individual user agent string for more HTTP requests
