  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Corrected the statement before installing an application: The order in
    which LDAP-schema extensions are installed is important. They have to be
    installed first on the DC master and then on the DC backups.
    If an application requires an extension of the LDAP schema, a reminder was
    shown just before installation that the domain has to be prepared. This
    reminder is removed when installing on an DC master.
  * Upgrades of an application are now correctly identified as "update".
  * Allows requesting a new license while trying to upgrade an already
    installed application.
  * Fixed an error when searching for packages apt knows about but which do not
    have a candidate in any repository.
  * Added hardware requirements for an app: Check if enough memory is currently
    available.
