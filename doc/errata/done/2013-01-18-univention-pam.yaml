fix: 6.0.10-2.204.201301241621
note:
desc: |
 This errata fixes to issues:
 * The template for /etc/nsswitch.conf was fixed to handle the UCR
   variable nss/group/cachefile correctly, which can be used to
   disable group caching.
 * As a follow-up patch to the "pam" patch, the UCR variable
   'pamaccess/maxent' is added to configure the maximum buffer size
   needed to check group membership in large environments. The maximum
   is increased to 4 MiB.
