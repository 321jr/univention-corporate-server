  * Fixed a traceback which occured when removing the network
    from a computer.
  * A mapping which broke the representation of TXT records for DNS forward
    zones has been fixed.
  * The pointer record attribute of the DNS pointer module is now a multi
    value attribute.
  * The attributes "User ID", "Group ID" and "GECOS" in the users module,
    "FQDN" in the computers module and "Next IP" in the network module
    have been removed from the advanced search as they are not searchable
    in the UMC.
