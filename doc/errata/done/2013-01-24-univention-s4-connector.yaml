fix: 7.0.22-9.365.201301241501

  This update fixes the following S4 connector issues:
  * Invalid temporary pickle files could result in a termination of the
    process.
  * The S4 connector got stuck for a few minutes if the process used a
    network interface, which was shut down. The running connector
    will now be restarted if a network device is shutdown.
  * The S4 connector calls the daemon function too late thus can result in
    a crash of the connector.
