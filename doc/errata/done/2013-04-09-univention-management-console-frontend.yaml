  * Inside the "favorite" category, favorites can no longer be removed.
  * The username input field of the login dialog stays disabled after a failed
    relogin
  * Automatic scrollbars in the Dialog widget has been fixed.
  * The internal caching mechanism for list entries (e.g., DHCP/DNS entries and
    IP/MAC addresses for computers) has been improved as it could previously
    lead to inconsistencies in rare cases.

    no exclamation mark has been displayed when a widget had an invalid value.
