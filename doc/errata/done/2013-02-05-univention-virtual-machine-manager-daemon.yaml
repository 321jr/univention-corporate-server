note:
desc: |
  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * UVMM failed to start when its internal cache files were truncated.
    This has been fixed.
  * Snapshots of VMs with writeable raw images are no longer allowed.
  * Floppies are now by default attached read-only.
  * Empty drives are allowed for snapshots.
  * Removing empty drives no longer asks for deleting the volume.
  * Snapshot operations are still accessible even when
    non-snapshotable images are attached.
