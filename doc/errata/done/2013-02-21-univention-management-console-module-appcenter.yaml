fix: 2.0.91-1.96.201302271642
note:
version: 0
desc: |
  This erratum fixed several issues:
  * Speeded up opening the App Center by caching the files locally.
  * A new module was added showing details of every installed application.
  * The details of an application were always the one of the newest version on
    the server, even when an older version was installed. This has been fixed.
  * Whether an application can be upgraded was not checked accurately enough.
  * Unnecessary "-errata" repository is not added any more.
  * When an application is installed that includes an extension of the LDAP
    schema the corresponding packages are installed automatically on the DC
    Master and DC Backups by connecting to them via HTTPS.
