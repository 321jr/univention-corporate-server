  An update for the Univention Debmirror package was missed for UCS-3.1-1,
  which includes a fix for bug 30409:

  http://updates.software-univention.de/ is now always configured as the
  initial repository server, because some external DNS servers always return a
  valid address for univention-repository.$domainname. If a local repository is
  used, the Univention Config Registry variable repository/online/server must
  be changed manually, best through a Repository Policy.
