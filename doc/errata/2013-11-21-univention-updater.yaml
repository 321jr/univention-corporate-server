  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * If a component is blocking a release update and this component is from the
    App Center, link to the app instead of showing a cryptic error message
  * Fixed the error handling in case the UMC server is restarted during an
    update
  * Fixed a JavaScript error when installing package updates
