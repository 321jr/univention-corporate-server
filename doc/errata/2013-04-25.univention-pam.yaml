  libnss-ldap uses in some environments the DNS SRV LDAP record to look up the
  LDAP server instead of using the configured LDAP sever from
  /etc/libnss-ldap.conf. This erratum added the new UCR variable nssldap/nss_srv
  to specify whether or not libnss-ldap is allowed to perform dns srv record
  lookups (default: true)
