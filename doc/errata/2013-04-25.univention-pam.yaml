fix: 6.0.13-4.210.201304251654
note: |
  libnss-ldap uses in some environments the
  DNS SRV LDAP record to look up the LDAP
  server instead of using the configured LDAP
  sever from /etc/libnss-ldap.conf.
  This erratum added a configuration switch to
  libnss-ldap.conf to disable the DNS look up.
  The default is unchanged and the DNS look up
  can be disabled by setting nssldap/nss_srv
  to false.
version: [1]
desc: |
  Added ucrv nssldap/nss_srv specify whether or 
  not libnss-ldap is allowed to perform
  dns srv record lookups (default: true)
