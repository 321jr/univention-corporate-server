src: libnss-ldap
fix: 264-2.2.47.201304251546
note: |
  libnss-ldap uses in some environments the 
  DNS SRV LDAP record to look up the LDAP
  server instead of using the configured LDAP
  sever from /etc/libnss-ldap.conf.
  This erratum added a configuration switch to 
  libnss-ldap.conf to disable the DNS look up.
  The default is unchanged and the DNS look up 
  can be disabled by setting nssldap/nss_srv
  to false.
version: [1]
desc: |
  Added config option nss_srv to deny dns srv record lookups
