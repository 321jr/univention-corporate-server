  libnss-ldap uses in some environments the
  DNS SRV LDAP record to look up the LDAP
  server instead of using the configured LDAP
  sever from /etc/libnss-ldap.conf.
  This erratum added a configuration switch to
  libnss-ldap.conf to disable the DNS look up.
  The default is unchanged and the DNS look up
  can be disabled by setting nssldap/nss_srv
  to false.
  This update also fixes an issue to prevent 
  override of libnss-ldap.secret in postinst
  if it is a link.
