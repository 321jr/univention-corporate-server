note:
version: [1]
desc: |
  This errata update fixes several bugs in the package univention-samba4:
  * Join into a new samba4/join/site without Samba4 on the Master failed.
    Now the chosen samba4/dc is respected also in this case.
  * The sysvol-sync.py script did not preserve timestamps, now it does.
  * The sysvol-cleanup.py script moved the PolicyDefinitions away.
    Now it only deals with Policies/{* paths.
  * Periodic refresh of sysvol fACLs for the group "Authenticated Users" can
    now be disabled with the new UCR variable samba4/sysvol/sync/setfacl/AU.
  * Samba4 DCs are now added to the group Enterprise Domain Controllers
    by default during initial join.
