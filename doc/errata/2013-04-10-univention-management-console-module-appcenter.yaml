fix: 2.0.139-8.130.201305031428

  This update fixes several issues:
  * Fixed an issue when closing the App Center tab in the Management Console:
    The backend shut down the module when no further requests regarding the
    progress of an installation was sent. When this happened during
    installation the package database could become temporarily broken.
  * Added a progress bar while fetching software changes in App Center and
    speeded up the process of retrieving this information.
  * Made free memory calculation more robust in OpenVZ environments.
  * The width of the dialog has been corrected.
  * The full progress bar is used while installing an application when not
    installing packages on other servers in the domain.
  * The button to request a new license is shown even when the application
    cannot be installed.
  * If an application is installed, the system does not dist-upgrade anymore.
    If the app is upgraded, the system still does a dist-upgrade but shows a
    warning that the dist-upgrade may include errata updates.
