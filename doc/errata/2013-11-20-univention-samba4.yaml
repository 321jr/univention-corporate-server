  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Samba4 could not be started on host with only IPv6 interfaces.
    This has been fixed by deactivating wins support on IPv6 hosts.
  * Multiple logroate configurations for samba log files could lead 
    to warning messages via cron. These redundant configurations are
    removed with this update.
