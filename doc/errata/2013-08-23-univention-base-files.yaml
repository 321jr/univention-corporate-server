  During the update from UCS-3.0 to UCS-3.1 the template for
  /etc/network/interfaces was converted from a single-file template
  into a multi-file template. To preserve modifications to the
  template, the original template was moved to the new location.

  This causes an error with the network tools, since the declaration
  of the loopback interface was separated into its own template
  fragment and now appears twice in the generated file.

  On installing this erratum, the duplicate declaration for the
  loopback interface is commented out from the moved template files.

  During the update the automatic restart of the network is disabled.
