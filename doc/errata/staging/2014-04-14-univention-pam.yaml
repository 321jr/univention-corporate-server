  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Kerberos authentication is now limited to non-local accounts with
    UID >= 1000. The limit can be configured through the new Univention
    Configuration Registry variable 'pam/krb5/minimum_uid'.
  * The mapping of user and group names in the config registry templates was
    not updated in all cases. This has been fixed.
