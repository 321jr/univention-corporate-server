  This update addresses the following issues:
  - When using the command line tool 'univention-upgrade' all components
    blocking an update are now displayed.
  - Detect broken HTTP proxies like DansGuardian, which block downloading the
    Packages files and updater scripts while still signalling success.
  - univention-add-app now has an option to list all available App IDs using
    univention-add-app --list
  - Delay requested reboot after all updates have been performed.
  - Adapted the link to the new errata overview page inside the updater module.
  - Open the Software Update UMC module upon UMC startup during release updates
    and show a information dialog about the current update process.
