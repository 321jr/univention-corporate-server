version: [2]
desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
   * A parameter to open a specific object immediately on opening the module
     has been added.
   * The "Shares" module has been moved into the "Domain" category.
   * If multiple policies of the same type are referenced UMC prevents
     removing policy references when saving the object.
   * Errors during requesting a new license are now handled.
   * The default user template for new users can be configured via the UCR
     variable "directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/add/default". The
     variable expects the DN or the label of a user template.
   * If too many user accounts for the license have been created, the UMC
     now provides information about how to re-enable editing.
