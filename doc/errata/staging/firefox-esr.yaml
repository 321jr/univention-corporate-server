 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * 
 * Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 59, Firefox ESR 52.7, and Thunderbird 52.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5150)
 * A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while enumerating attributes during SVG animations with clip paths. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5154)
 * A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while adjusting layout during SVG animations with text paths. This results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5155)
 CVE_2018-5156 is resolved
 * Same-origin protections for the PDF viewer can be bypassed, allowing a malicious site to intercept messages meant for the viewer. This could allow the site to retrieve PDF files restricted to viewing by an authenticated user on a third-party website. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.8 and Firefox < 60. (CVE-2018-5157)
 * The PDF viewer does not sufficiently sanitize PostScript calculator functions, allowing malicious JavaScript to be injected through a crafted PDF file. This JavaScript can then be run with the permissions of the PDF viewer by its worker. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.8 and Firefox < 60. (CVE-2018-5158)
 * An integer overflow can occur in the Skia library due to 32-bit integer use in an array without integer overflow checks, resulting in possible out-of-bounds writes. This could lead to a potentially exploitable crash triggerable by web content. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5159)
 * Sites can bypass security checks on permissions to install lightweight themes by manipulating the "baseURI" property of the theme element. This could allow a malicious site to install a theme without user interaction which could contain offensive or embarrassing images. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 52.8, Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Firefox < 60, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5168)
 * A buffer overflow was found during UTF8 to Unicode string conversion within JavaScript with extremely large amounts of data. This vulnerability requires the use of a malicious or vulnerable legacy extension in order to occur. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5178)
 * Mozilla developers backported selected changes in the Skia library. These changes correct memory corruption issues including invalid buffer reads and writes during graphic operations. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird ESR < 52.8, Thunderbird < 52.8, and Firefox ESR < 52.8. (CVE-2018-5183)
