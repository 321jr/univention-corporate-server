desc: |
 This update fixes the following issues. Please note that issues affecting
 the MIT Kerberos kadmind, and the MIT Kerberos KDC are not relevant for UCS
 by default, as UCS uses the Heimdal Kerberos implementation. For completeness
 they are listed here as well:
 * An authenticated attacker can cause kadmind to leak memory by supplying
   a null principal name in a request which uses one. Repeating these requests
   will eventually cause kadmind to exhaust all available memory
   (CVE-2015-8631).
 * kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 does not verify whether '\0' characters exist
   as expected, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive
   information or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via
   a crafted string (CVE-2015-8629).
 * An authenticated remote attacker can cause a denial of service on the KDC
   (out-of-bounds read and KDC crash) via an initial '\0' character in a long
   realm field within a TGS request (CVE-2015-2697). 
 * Remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SPNEGO packet
   (incorrect pointer read and process crash) on applications using the GSSAPI
   implementation of MIT Kerberos 5 (CVE-2015-2695)
 * Remote attackers may obtain sensitive information from process heap memory
   by sniffing the network for data in a handle field. This affects
   applications using libgssrpc (CVE-2014-9423)
 * kadmind incorrectly validates server principal name (CVE-2014-9422)
 * kadmind doubly frees partial deserialization results (CVE-2014-9421)
 * gss_process_context_token() incorrectly frees context (CVE-2014-5352)
 * Buffer overrun in kadmind with LDAP backend (CVE-2014-4345)
 * NULL dereference in SPNEGO acceptor (CVE-2014-4344)
 * Double-free in SPNEGO initiator during renegotiation (CVE-2014-4343)
 * Denial of service due to improper GSSAPI message validation
   (CVE-2014-4341, CVE-2014-4342)
 * The kpasswd service in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 does not properly validate
   UDP packets before sending responses, which allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) via a forged
   packet that triggers a communication loop (CVE-2002-2443)
