 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
   read and crash) via a crafted TIFF image to the (1) checkInkNamesString
   function in tif_dir.c in the thumbnail tool, (2) compresscontig function in
   tiff2bw.c in the tiff2bw tool, (3) putcontig8bitCIELab function in
   tif_getimage.c in the tiff2rgba tool, LZWPreDecode function in tif_lzw.c in
   the (4) tiff2ps or (5) tiffdither tool, (6) NeXTDecode function in
   tif_next.c in the tiffmedian tool, or (7)
   TIFFWriteDirectoryTagLongLong8Array function in tif_dirwrite.c in the
   tiffset tool. (CVE-2014-8127)
 * The TIFFWriteDirectoryTagLongLong8Array function in tif_dirwrite.c in the
   tiffset tool allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) via vectors involving the ma variable. (CVE-2016-3658)
 * tif_predict.h and tif_predict.c have assertions that can lead to assertion
   failures in debug mode, or buffer overflows in release mode, when dealing
   with unusual tile size like YCbCr with subsampling. Reported as MSVR 35105,
   aka "Predictor heap-buffer-overflow." (CVE-2016-9535)
 * Stack-based buffer overflow in the _TIFFVGetField function in tif_dir.c
   4.0.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
   crafted TIFF file. (CVE-2016-10095)
 * LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted TIFF image,
   related to libtiff/tif_read.c:351:22. (CVE-2016-10266)
 * LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted TIFF image,
   related to libtiff/tif_ojpeg.c:816:8. (CVE-2016-10267)
 * LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based
   buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   TIFF image, related to "READ of size 512" and libtiff/tif_unix.c:340:2.
   (CVE-2016-10269)
 * LibTIFF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based
   buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   TIFF image, related to "READ of size 8" and libtiff/tif_read.c:523:22.
   (CVE-2016-10270)
 * LibTIFF is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow in the tools/tiffcp
   resulting in DoS or code execution via a crafted BitsPerSample value.
   (CVE-2017-5225)
 * The putagreytile function in tif_getimage.c has a left-shift undefined
   behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
   crafted image. (CVE-2017-7592)
 * tif_read.c does not ensure that tif_rawdata is properly initialized, which
   might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process
   memory via a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7593)
 * The OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesDcTable function in tif_ojpeg.c allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted
   image. (CVE-2017-7594)
 * The JPEGSetupEncode function in tiff_jpeg.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via
   a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7595)
 * LibTIFF has an "outside the range of representable values of type float"
   undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7596)
 * tif_dirread.c has an "outside the range of representable values of type
   float" undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7597)
 * tif_dirread.c might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted image.
   (CVE-2017-7598)
 * LibTIFF has an "outside the range of representable values of type short"
   undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7599)
 * LibTIFF has an "outside the range of representable values of type unsigned
   char" undefined behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7600)
 * LibTIFF has a "shift exponent too large for 64-bit type long" undefined
   behavior issue, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
   crafted image. (CVE-2017-7601)
 * LibTIFF has a signed integer overflow, which might allow remote attackers
   to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via a crafted image. (CVE-2017-7602)
 * LibTIFF has an invalid read in the _TIFFVGetField function in tif_dir.c,
   which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
   a crafted TIFF file. (CVE-2017-9147)
 * A memory leak vulnerability was found in the function
   TIFFReadDirEntryLong8Array in tif_dirread.c, which allows attackers to
   cause a denial of service via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9403)
 * A memory leak vulnerability was found in the function
   OJPEGReadHeaderInfoSecTablesQTable in tif_ojpeg.c, which allows attackers
   to cause a denial of service via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9404)
 * CVE-2017-9935: Heap-based buffer overflow in t2p_write_pdf function
 * There is a memory leak in tif_jbig.c. A crafted TIFF document can lead to a
   memory leak resulting in a remote denial of service attack. (CVE-2017-9936)
 * There is a assertion abort in the TIFFWriteDirectoryTagCheckedLong8Array
   function in tif_dirwrite.c. A crafted input will lead to a remote denial of
   service attack. (CVE-2017-10688)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in tiff2pdf (CVE-2017-11335)
 * Mishandled memory allocation for short files in the TIFFReadDirEntryArray
   function (CVE-2017-12944)
 * Reachable assertion abort in the function TIFFWriteDirectorySec()
   (CVE-2017-13726)
 * Reachable assertion abort in the function TIFFWriteDirectoryTagSubifd()
   (CVE-2017-13727)
 * NULL pointer dereference in tif_print.c:TIFFPrintDirectory() causes crash
   (CVE-2017-18013)
