desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * PostgreSQL runs under a non-root operating system account, and database
   superusers have effective ability to run arbitrary code under that system
   account. PostgreSQL provides a script for starting the database server
   during system boot. Packages of PostgreSQL for many operating systems
   provide their own, packager-authored startup implementations. Several
   implementations use a log file name that the database superuser can replace
   with a symbolic link. As root, they open(), chmod() and/or chown() this log
   file name. This often suffices for the database superuser to escalate to
   root privileges when root starts the server. (CVE-2017-12172)
 * Invalid json_populate_recordset or jsonb_populate_recordset function calls
   can crash the server or disclose a few bytes of server memory.
