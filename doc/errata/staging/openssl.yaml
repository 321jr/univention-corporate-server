desc: |
 This update fixes the following issues:
 * PKCS#7 and CMS routines: malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure OpenSSL
   will leak memory (CVE-2015-3195)
 * A malicious client can negotiate SSLv2 ciphers that have been
   disabled on the server and complete SSLv2 handshakes even if all
   SSLv2 ciphers have been disabled, provided that the SSLv2 protocol
   was not also disabled via SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2 (CVE-2015-3197)
 * Additionally, when using a DHE cipher suite a new DH key will
   always be generated for each connection.
 * EVP_EncodeUpdate overflow (CVE-2016-2105)
 * EVP_EncryptUpdate overflow (CVE-2016-2106)
 * Memory corruption in the ASN.1 encoder (CVE-2016-2108)
