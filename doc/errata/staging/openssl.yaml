 version 1.0.1t-1:
 * Denial of service in DTLS (CVE-2014-3571, CVE-2015-0206)

 * Bignum squaring may produce incorrect results (CVE-2014-3570)
 * Remote denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or
   unspecified other impact (CVE-2016-2177)

   dsa_sign_setup function in crypto/dsa/dsa_ossl.c (CVE-2016-2178)
 * Remote denial of service (memory consumption) by maintaining many crafted
   DTLS sessions simultaneously (CVE-2016-2179)
