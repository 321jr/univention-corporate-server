desc: |
  * Adjusted the styling of the notification if JavaScript is disabled.
  * Internet Explorer now shows a warning message if a version <= 8 is
    being used.
  * A exception was logged in the JavaScript console when the grid was resized.
    This was disturbing and has therefore been removed.
  * The JavaScript method umc.tools.umcpProgressSubCommand did not send the
    UMCP flavor along with a request and could therefore fail due to
    insufficient permissions.
  * The warning if IE <= 8 is being used now lists all supported browsers.
    If an outdated browser is being used a message will be shown in the
    login dialog. A notification after the login will no longer show up.
  * The icon on the policy reference button is now shown
