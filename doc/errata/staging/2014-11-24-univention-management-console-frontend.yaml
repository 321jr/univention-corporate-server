  * Adjusted the styling of the notification if javascript is disabled.
  * Internet Explorer now shows a warning message if a version <= 8 is 
    beeing used.
  * A exception was logged in the javascript console when the grid was resized.
    This was disturbing and has therefore be removed.
  * The JavaScript method umc.tools.umcpProgressSubCommand did not send the UMCP
    flavor along with a request and could therefore fail due to insufficient
    permissions.
  * The warning if IE <= 8 is beeing used now lists all supported browsers.
    If an outdated brwoser is beeing used a message will be shown in the 
    login dialog. A notification after the login will no longer show up.
