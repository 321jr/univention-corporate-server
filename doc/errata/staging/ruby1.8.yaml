 The following issues were fixed:
 * DL::dlopen could open a library with tainted library name (CVE-2009-5147)
 * The VpMemAlloc function in bigdecimal.c in the BigDecimal class
   does not properly allocate memory, which allows context-dependent
   attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
   (application crash) via vectors involving creation of a large
   BigDecimal value within a 64-bit process, related to an
   "integer truncation issue." (CVE-2011-0188)
 * Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking,
   which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict
   the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number
   sequence obtained in a different child process (CVE-2011-2686)
 * The SecureRandom.random_bytes function in lib/securerandom.rb
   relies on PID values for initialization, which makes it easier
   for context-dependent attackers to predict the result string
   by leveraging knowledge of random strings obtained in an earlier
   process with the same PID (CVE-2011-2705)
 * Hash values computed without restricting the ability to trigger
   hash collisions predictably, allowing context-dependent attackers
   to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input
   to an application that maintains a hash table (CVE-2011-4815)
 * The REXML parser allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (memory consumption) via a crafted XML document, aka an XML
   Entity Expansion (XEE) attack (CVE-2014-8080, CVE-2014-8090)
 * OpenSSL extension hostname matching implementation violates RFC 6125
   (CVE-2015-1855)
