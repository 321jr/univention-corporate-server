 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When acquiring new uidNumber or gidNumber ensure they do not collide with
   each other.
 * DNS TXT records are now shown via the DNS UMC module.
 * In some cases the automatic update of the attribute "displayName" caused
   tracebacks in S4 connector. The UDM module users/user has been updated to
   fix this traceback.
