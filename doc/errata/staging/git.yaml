desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A malicious third-party can give a crafted "ssh://..." URL to an
   unsuspecting victim, and an attempt to visit the URL can result in any
   program that exists on the victim's machine being executed. Such a URL
   could be placed in the .gitmodules file of a malicious project, and an
   unsuspecting victim could be tricked into running "git clone
   --recurse-submodules" to trigger the vulnerability. (CVE-2017-1000117)
 * Git uses unsafe Perl scripts to support subcommands such as cvsserver,
   which allows attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via shell
   metacharacters in a module name. The vulnerable code is reachable via
   git-shell even without CVS support. (CVE-2017-14867)
