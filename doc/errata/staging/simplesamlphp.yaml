fix: 1.16.3-1A~4.4.0.201907162025
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * SimpleSAMLphp has been updated to version 1.16.3.
 * HTTPRedirect.php in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.4 has
   an incorrect check of return values in the signature validation utilities,
   allowing an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid by
   forcing an error during validation. This occurs because of a dependency
   on PHP functionality that interprets a -1 error code as a true boolean
   value. (CVE-2018-7711)
 * SimpleSAMLphp before 1.15.2 allows remote attackers to bypass an open
   redirect protection mechanism via crafted authority data in a URL.
   (CVE-2018-6520)
 * The (1) Htpasswd authentication source in the authcrypt module and (2)
   SimpleSAML_Session class in SimpleSAMLphp 1.14.11 and earlier allow remote
   attackers to conduct timing side-channel attacks by leveraging use of the
   standard comparison operator to compare secret material against user input.
   (CVE-2017-12872)
 * SimpleSAMLphp 1.14.12 and earlier make it easier for man-in-the-middle
   attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging use of the
   aesEncrypt and aesDecrypt methods in the SimpleSAML/Utils/Crypto class
   to protect session identifiers in replies to non-HTTPS service providers.
   (CVE-2017-12870)
 * The aesEncrypt method in lib/SimpleSAML/Utils/Crypto.php in SimpleSAMLphp
   1.14.x through 1.14.11 makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
   bypass the encryption protection mechanism by leveraging use of the first
   16 bytes of the secret key as the initialization vector (IV).
