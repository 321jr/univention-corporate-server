desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The code base has been converted to Python 3.
 * Invalid Python string literals are now detected.
 * UCS templates are checked for compatibility with Python 2 and 3.
 * `debian/compat` is now checked for consistency with the declared versioned
   build dependency of `debhelper` in `debian/control`.
 * `debian/*.dirs` is now checked for un-needed entries which are already
   created indirectly by other steps.
 * New `debhelper` related files in `debian/` are recognized.
 * `debian/*.ucs files are checked more strictly due to the switch to Python
   3. For example duplicate keys are now errors.
 * The `debian/changelog` file is checked for strict-monotonic entries. In the
   past this has lead to surprising update results as the timestamp of the
   latest entry is used for many things during the package build.
 * Un-join-script files are now checked for errors, too.
 * Debian maintainer script `debian/*.{pre,post}{inst,rm}` are now checked for
   handling wrong actions.
 * `ucslint` has been removed as a direct dependency from all UCS packages as
   it now runs directly from our CI pipeline.
