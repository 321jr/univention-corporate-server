  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The internal cache of UMC modules in the UMC Server is now invalidated
    before they are requested.
  * Changes of system clock (e.g. due to NTP updates) will not make UMC
    processes die by timeout anymore.
  * It is now possible for UMC modules to provide a user friendly error message
    when initialization failed.
  * The UMC server parses operation set strings more carefully now to avoid
    server crashes.
  * The error handling of requests have been improved.
