desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * It is now prevented that regular users can change their object class.
 * Users can now only create objects with univentionAdminUserSettings object
   class underneath of "cn=admin-settings".
 * Starting the ldap daemon on i686 systems with a mdb backend
   and a mdb maxsize of at least 2147483648 could potentially fail.
   The init script now triple checks the start.
