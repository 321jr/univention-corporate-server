fix: 15.0.0-38A~4.4.0.202003031723
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The init script for `slapd` now looks for running process only below parent
   PID 1 specifically. This allows running other `slapd` processes in
   containers.
 * The 'slapo-lastbind' LDAP overlay can now be activated via the UCR variable
   `ldap/overlay/lastbind` which when activated stores the time-stamp of a
   successful bind to an LDAP server. The script
   `/usr/share/univention-ldap/univention_lastbind.py` can be used to store
   the youngest of these timestamps, from all reachable LDAP servers, into the
   `lastbind` extended attribute of a specified user.
