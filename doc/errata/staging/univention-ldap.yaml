desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The UCR variable ldap/limits has been added to configure slapd limits.
 * The slapd backup cronjob can now be disabled by setting the UCR
   variable slapd/backup to false. The cron interval can be configured with
   the UCR variable slapd/backup/cron. 
 * The ldap client paramaters NETWORK_TIMEOUT, TIMEOUT and TIMELIMIT can
   now be configured with the UCR variables ldap/client/network_timeout,
   ldap/client/timeout and ldap/client/timelimit.
 * A bug in the slapd.conf template has been fixed.
 * The UCR variable ldap/index/quickmode has been added. If set to true
   the LDAP reindex tool (ldap_setup_index) is started in quick mode
   (fewer integrity checks, improved indexing time)
