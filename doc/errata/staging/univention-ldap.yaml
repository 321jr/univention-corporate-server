  This update addresses the following issue:
  * When a domain controller (DC) master or DC backup is created, two
    policies are now created or modified: a LDAP server policy to be used
    by member servers and a UCR policy be used by DC slaves.
    The policies configure them to use the LDAP servers of all available
    DC backups, in case the DC master is down.
