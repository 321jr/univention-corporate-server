desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Fix regression in `cn=translog` setup, which reset the LDAP indices. If an
   UCS-4.3 system was updated to erratum 426 and only later to this erratum,
   it might reset the LDAP attributes, which are indexed, to the default. This
   may lead to slow LDAP searches. If other attributes were added manually to
   the UCR variables 'ldap/index/eq', 'ldap/index/sub', 'ldap/index/pres',
   they must be restored manually. The old values might be recovered from the
   log file '/var/log/univention/config-registry.replog'.
