fix: 15.0.0-38A~4.4.0.202003031723
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The init script for `slapd` now looks for running process only below parent
   pid 1 specifically. This allows running other `slapd` processes in
   containers.
 * The 'slapo-lastbind' LDAP overlay can now be activated via the
   'ldap/overlay/lastbind' UCR variable which when activated stores the
   timestamp of a successful bind to an LDAP server. The 
   '/usr/share/univention-ldap/univention_lastbind.py' script can be used to
   store the youngest of these timestamps, from all reachable LDAP servers,
   into the 'lastbind' extended attribute of a specified user.
