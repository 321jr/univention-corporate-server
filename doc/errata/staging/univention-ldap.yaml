fix: 15.0.0-20
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * OpenLDAP restricts the number of returned entries when searching. This can
   be configured using the UCR variable 'ldap/sizelimit', which defaults to
   400k. This is not enough for `univention-translog prune`. Remove the limit
   for parged searches connecting via <ldapi:///>.
