fix: 12.1.6-29.822.201607150956
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Regular users are prevented from changing their object class.
 * Users can now only create objects with univentionAdminUserSettings object
   class underneath of "cn=admin-settings".
 * Starting the LDAP daemon on i686 systems with a mdb backend
   and a mdb maxsize of at least 2147483648 could potentially fail.
   The init script now triple checks the start.
 * Various restrictions for Memberserver and Domaincontrollers have been added
   to the LDAP ACL's.
