  This update addresses the following issue:
  * When a domain controller (DC) master or DC backup is created, two
    policies are now created or modified: a LDAP server policy to be used
    by member servers and a UCR policy be used by DC slaves.
    The policies configure them to use the LDAP servers of all available
    DC backups, in case the DC master is down. The LDAP server policy is
    activated on members, the UCR policy for slaves is not actived by
    default.
