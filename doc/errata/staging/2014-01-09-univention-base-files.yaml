desc: |
 NTP servers reachable from the public internet that respond to the "monlist" query can be used to facilitate DDoS attacks. (CVE-2013-5211)
 This update adds the UCR variable "ntp/noquery" which can be set to "true" to disable most queries including the "monlist" function and thus mitigates this issue.
 It is recommended to set this UCRV on any UCS system that exposes the NTP service to the internet.
