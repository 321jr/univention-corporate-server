fix: 2.7.8.dfsg-2.51.201601281703
desc: |
 A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file
 that, when processed by an application using libxml2, would cause
 that application to use an excessive amount of CPU, leak potentially
 sensitive information, or crash the application.
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Denial of service processing a crafted XML document (CVE-2015-1819)
 * Out-of-bounds memory access (CVE-2015-7941)
 * Heap-buffer-overflow in xmlParseConditionalSections (CVE-2015-7942)
 * Denial of service (CPU consumption) in xmlStringLenDecodeEntities
   when processing specially crafted XML input (CVE-2015-5312)
 * Denial of service due to heap-based buffer overflow in the
   xmlDictComputeFastQKey (CVE-2015-7497)
 * Denial of service due to heap-based buffer overflow in
   xmlParseXmlDecl (CVE-2015-7498)
 * Information discosure due to heap-based buffer overflow in the
   xmlGROW (CVE-2015-7499)
 * Denial of service due to out-of-bounds heap read in xmlParseMisc
   (CVE-2015-7500)
 * Denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application
   crash) via crafted XML data due to Buffer overread with XML parser
   in xmlNextChar (CVE-2015-8241)
 * Out-of-bounds heap read when parsing file with unfinished xml
   declaration (CVE-2015-8317)
