 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the XCF property
   handling functionality of SDL_image 2.0.1. A specially crafted xcf file can
   cause a stack-based buffer overflow resulting in potential code execution.
   An attacker can provide a specially crafted XCF file to trigger this
   vulnerability. (CVE-2017-2887)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ILBM image
   rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted ILBM image
   can cause a heap overflow resulting in code execution. An attacker can
   display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
   (CVE-2017-12122)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ILBM image
   rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted ILBM image
   can cause a stack overflow resulting in code execution. An attacker can
   display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
   (CVE-2017-14440)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the ICO image
   rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted ICO image
   can cause an integer overflow, cascading to a heap overflow resulting in
   code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted image to
   trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2017-14441)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the BMP image
   rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted BMP image
   can cause a stack overflow resulting in code execution. An attacker can
   display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
   (CVE-2017-14442)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
   rendering functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted XCF image
   can cause a heap overflow resulting in code execution. An attacker can
   display a specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
   (CVE-2017-14448)
 * A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the GIF image parsing
   functionality of SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially crafted GIF image can lead
   to a buffer overflow on a global section. An attacker can display an image
   to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2017-14450)
 * An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the PCX image
   rendering functionality of Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image-2.0.2. A
   specially crafted PCX image can cause an out-of-bounds read on the heap,
   resulting in information disclosure . An attacker can display a specially
   crafted image to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2018-3837)
 * An exploitable information vulnerability exists in the XCF image rendering
   functionality of Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image-2.0.2. A specially
   crafted XCF image can cause an out-of-bounds read on the heap, resulting in
   information disclosure. An attacker can display a specially crafted image
   to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2018-3838)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
   rendering functionality of Simple DirectMedia Layer SDL2_image-2.0.2. A
   specially crafted XCF image can cause an out-of-bounds write on the heap,
   resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a specially crafted
   image to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2018-3839)
