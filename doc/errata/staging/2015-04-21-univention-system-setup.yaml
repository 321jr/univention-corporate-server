  This errata update addresses the following issues:
  * A reload of apache is now disabled during the complete configuration of a
    UCS appliance. This has been done in order to avoid access problems at the
    end of the wizard when accessing UMC via HTTPS.
  * The city search widget has been improved w.r.t. its usability.
  * The progress bar has been adjusted to reach 100%, its localization has been
    corrected to match the chosen one, and its output has been improved.
  * Output written into /var/log/univention/setup.log is now regularly flushed.
