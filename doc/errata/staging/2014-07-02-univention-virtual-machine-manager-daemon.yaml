fix: 
version: [3]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issue:
  * The list of virtual machines now refreshes automatically in the UMC grid
    when leaving the detail page of a virtual machine (as actions taken there
    can influence the state of the machine). Also, the UCR variable
    uvmm/umc/autosearch now only prevents the very first search on startup;
    manually clicking on the tree on the left refreshes the list even when
    autosearch is disabled.
    Additionally, the grid is updated non-invasively at a configurable
    interval (new UCR variable uvmm/umc/autoupdate/interval).
  * Paused VMs are now handled more similar to running VMs, which allows, for
    exmaple, VNC to be used for paused VMs, too.
