  This update fixes the following issue:
  * The list of virtual machines now refreshes automatically in the UMC grid
    when leaving the detail page of a virtual machine (as actions taken there
    can influence the state of the machine). Also, the UCR variable
    uvmm/umc/autosearch now only prevents the very first search on startup;
    manually clicking on the tree on the left refreshes the list even when
    autosearch is disabled.
