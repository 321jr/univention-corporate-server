 This errata update fixes several issues:
 * The protocol of a printer URI in the printers UMC module was always set to
   "cups-pdf://".  Fixed this by adding setInitialValue method to ComplexInput
   widget.
 * Added branding translation scope to all UMC files
 * Reversed the traceback when sending errors via mail because the web or mail
   client could truncate the interesting part.
 * Fixed MultiSelect widget setting its values too early which could break page
   rendering.
