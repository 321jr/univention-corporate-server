desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The UMC grid can now allow the execution of an action even though some of
    the selected items are not executable w.r.t. to the action.
  * A function has been added to reload the modules of the overview tab on the fly.
  * A default link to UMC has been added on the UCS overview page for unjoined
    systems
  * When installing a new system which is neither a domaincontroller master nor a
    domaincontroller backup, the UMC entry in the UCS overview page will no longer
    consider the UMC a domain administration tool, as the domain wide modules are only
    available on master and backup systems.
