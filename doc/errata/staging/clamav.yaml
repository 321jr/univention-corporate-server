 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning
   functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and
   prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
   service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
   a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while
   indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could
   exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected
   device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap
   buffer out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result
   in a denial of service condition on an affected device. (CVE-2019-1787)
 * A vulnerability in the Object Linking & Embedding (OLE2) file scanning
   functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and
   prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
   service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack
   of proper input and validation checking mechanisms for OLE2 files sent an
   affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
   malformed OLE2 files to the device running an affected version ClamAV
   Software. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds
   write condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of
   service condition on an affected device. (CVE-2019-1788)
