desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * libclamav/message.c in allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted e-mail message. (CVE-2017-6418)
 * The wwunpack function in libclamav/wwunpack.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted PE file with
   WWPack compression. (CVE-2017-6420)
 * ClamAV has a use-after-free condition arising from a lack of input
   validation. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability with a
   crafted email message to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2017-12374)
 * ClamAV has a buffer overflow vulnerability arising from a lack of input
   validation. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send a crafted email
   message to the affected device, triggering a buffer overflow and
   potentially a denial of service when the malicious message is scanned.
   (CVE-2017-12375)
 * ClamAV has a buffer overflow vulnerability arising from improper input
   validation when handling Portable Document Format (PDF) files. An
   unauthenticated remote attacker could send a crafted PDF file to the
   affected device, triggering a buffer overflow and potentially a denial of
   service or arbitrary code execution when the malicious file is scanned.
   (CVE-2017-12376)
 * ClamAV has a heap overflow vulnerability arising from improper input
   validation when handling mew packets. An attacker could exploit this by
   sending a crafted message to the affected device, triggering a denial of
   service or possible arbitrary code execution when the malicious file is
   scanned. (CVE-2017-12377)
 * ClamAV has a buffer overread vulnerability arising from improper input
   validation when handling tape archive (TAR) files. An unauthenticated
   remote attacker could send a crafted TAR file to the affected device,
   triggering a buffer overread and potentially a denial of service when the
   malicious file is scanned. (CVE-2017-12378)
 * ClamAV has a buffer overflow vulnerability arising from improper input
   validation in the message parsing function. An unauthenticated remote
   attacker could send a crafted email message to the affected device,
   triggering a buffer overflow and potentially a denial of service or
   arbitrary code execution when the malicious message is scanned.
   (CVE-2017-12379)
 * ClamAV has a NULL dereference vulnerability arising from improper input
   validation in the message parsing function. An unauthenticated remote
   attacker could send a crafted email message to the affected device,
   triggering a NULL pointer dereference, which may result in a denial of
   service. (CVE-2017-12380)
