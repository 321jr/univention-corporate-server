 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A vulnerability in the Data-Loss-Prevention (DLP) module in Clam AntiVirus
   (ClamAV) Software versions 0.102.1 and 0.102.0 could allow an
   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on
   an affected device. The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read
   affecting users that have enabled the optional DLP feature. An attacker
   could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file to an
   affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV
   scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
   (CVE-2020-3123)
 * A vulnerability in the ARJ archive parsing module in Clam AntiVirus
   (ClamAV) Software versions 0.102.2 could allow an unauthenticated, remote
   attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The
   vulnerability is due to a heap buffer overflow read. An attacker could
   exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted ARJ file to an affected
   device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning
   process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition. (CVE-2020-3327)
 * A vulnerability in the PDF archive parsing module in Clam AntiVirus
   (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101 - 0.102.2 could allow an unauthenticated,
   remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected
   device. The vulnerability is due to a stack buffer overflow read. An
   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted PDF file to
   an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ClamAV
   scanning process crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.
