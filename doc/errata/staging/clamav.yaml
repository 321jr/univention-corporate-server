 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Remote denial of service due to an out-of-bounds read when ClamAV scans
   Portable Document Format (.pdf) files (CVE-2018-0202)
 * Remote denial of service due to HWP integer overflow with a resultant
   infinite loop via a crafted Hangul Word Processor (HWP) file
   (CVE-2018-0360)
 * Remote denial of service due to ClamAV lacking a PDF object length check,
   resulting in an unreasonably long time to parse a relatively small file
   (CVE-2018-0361)
 * Out of bounds heap memory read vulnerability in XAR parser, that can result
   in Leaking of memory, may help in developing exploit chains. This attack
   appear to be exploitable via the victim must scan a crafted XAR file
