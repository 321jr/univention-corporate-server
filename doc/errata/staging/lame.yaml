 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * 
 * The II_step_one function in layer2.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file. (CVE-2017-9869)
 * The III_i_stereo function in layer3.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file that is mishandled in the code for the "block_type == 2" case, a similar issue to CVE-2017-11126. (CVE-2017-9870)
 * The III_i_stereo function in layer3.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted audio file. (CVE-2017-9871)
 * The III_dequantize_sample function in layer3.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted audio file. (CVE-2017-9872)
 CVE_2017-13712 is open
 * LAME 3.99.5 has a heap-based buffer over-read when handling a malformed file in k_34_4 in vbrquantize.c. (CVE-2017-15018)
 CVE_2017-15019 is open
 * LAME 3.99.5 has a heap-based buffer over-read in fill_buffer in libmp3lame/util.c, related to lame_encode_buffer_sample_t in libmp3lame/lame.c, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-9410. (CVE-2017-15045)
 * LAME 3.99.5 has a stack-based buffer overflow in unpack_read_samples in frontend/get_audio.c, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-9412. (CVE-2017-15046)
