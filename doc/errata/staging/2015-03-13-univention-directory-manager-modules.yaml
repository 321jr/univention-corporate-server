  The following issues are addressed in this update:
  * Don't create a pointer record if no forward zone could be determined when
    modifying a computer object.
  * Repair --policies option of UDM command line tool.
  * Added a validation for the mail domain name to check if it is only composed
    of lowercase letters, the figures 0-9, full stops and hyphens.
    To restore the old behavior you can overwrite the syntax from the cli:
    ucr set \
    directory/manager/web/modules/mail/domain/properties/name/syntax='string'
