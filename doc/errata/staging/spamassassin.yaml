fix: 3.4.2-1~deb9u3
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin: Carefully
   crafted nefarious Configuration (`.cf`) files can be configured to run
   system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. This issue is less stealthy and
   attempts to exploit the issue will throw warnings. With this bug unpatched,
   exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios though doing so remotely
   is difficult. In addition to upgrading we again recommend that users should
   only use update channels or 3rd party `.cf` files from trusted places.
   (CVE-2020-1931)
 * A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin: Carefully
   crafted nefarious rule configuration (`.cf`) files can be configured to run
   system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. With this bug unpatched,
   exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios including the same
   privileges as `spamd` is run which may be elevated though doing so remotely
   is difficult. In addition to upgrading we again recommend that users should
   only use update channels or 3rd party `.cf` files from trusted places. If
   you cannot upgrade, do not use 3rd party rulesets, do not use `sa-compile`
   and do not run `spamd` as an account with elevated privileges.
