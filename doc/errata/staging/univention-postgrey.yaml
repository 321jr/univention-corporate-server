desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * In a fresh installation of univention-postgrey, the files
   /etc/postgrey/whitelist_clients.local and
   /etc/postgrey/whitelist_recipients.local are not included in the
   postgrey configuration, even though the corresponding UCR variables
   should force this. The creation of the .local files and the update
   of the postgrey configuration has been rearranged to fix this
   problem (Bug #50647).
