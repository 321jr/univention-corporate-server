  This update addresses the following issues:

    and re-marking the DHCP checkbox on the network page.
  * The default keyboard layout for language German has been corrected.
  * The package removal in appliance mode has been corrected.
  * Firefox address bar is always hidden in system setup.
  * The DHCP query of "Network settings" is working now as it should.
  * Fix the configuration of primary devices and bond-miimon in bonding network
    devices.
  * A timeout of 15 seconds has been added to the use of ntpdate to query the
    current time from a NTP time server, as this sometimes stalls endlessly.
  * The UCS domain check when selecting a system role has been adjusted to
    correctly determine an UCS domain.
  * The DNS error message when selecting a system role is now been prompted as
    an alert dialogue.
  * Some german text field descriptions has been adapted.
  * The UCS setup wizard UMC module could not be loaded when the system
    had more than four physical network devices.
  * It is now possible to prevent joining. The profile variable start/join was
    not evaluated.
  * Only system setup scripts belonging to the opened module are now executed
    when changing settings via the modules for changing Certificate, Language and
    Network settings.
  * Reset credentials if they are wrong
  * Fix basesystem deployment if no domainname is specified
  * The gateway input field is not required anymore. This allows to set up
    systems without connection to the internet.
  * The wizard now prevents scrollbars on every wizard page for systems with
    many network interfaces.
  * The wizard now shows information about how to reach the system and UMC after
    the configuration process.
