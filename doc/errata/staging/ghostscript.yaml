 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Ghostscript information disclosure through getenv, filenameforall
   (CVE-2013-5653)
 * Integer overflow in the gs_heap_alloc_bytes function in base/gsmalloc.c in
   Ghostscript 9.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (crash) via a crafted Postscript (ps) file, as demonstrated by
   using the ps2pdf command, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write
   (CVE-2015-3228)
 * various userparams allow %pipe% in paths, allowing remote shell command
   execution (CVE-2016-7976)
 * .libfile doesn't check PermitFileReading array, allowing remote file
   disclosure (CVE-2016-7977)
 * reference leak in .setdevice allows use-after-free and remote code
   execution (CVE-2016-7978)
 * type confusion in .initialize_dsc_parser allows remote code execution
   (CVE-2016-7979)
 * type confusion (CVE-2016-8602)

   through crafted content (CVE-2016-10219)

   crafted content (CVE-2016-10220)
 * Application crash with a segfault in ref_stack_index() triggered through
   crafted content (CVE-2017-5951)
