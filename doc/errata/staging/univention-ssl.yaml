   certificate.
 * 'univention-certificate new' now also accepts the '-days' parameter.
 * 'univention-certificate' now checks the UCS server role, as its full
   functionality is only available on the 'DC Master'.
 * Changing the UCRVs 'ssl/default/hashfunction' and 'ssl/default/bits' now
   takes immediate effect.
 * During the initial CA creation '0.debian.pool.ntp.org' is used in addition.
 * The certificate revocation list in now updated periodically. The intervals
   are configured through the UCRV 'ssl/crl/interval' and 'ssl/crl/validity'.
