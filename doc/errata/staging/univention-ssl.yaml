 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * If a host now adds the service "Wildcard Certificate", a wildcard
   certificate for that host is created ("*.$fqdn") on the DC Master. A new
   tool univention-fetch-certificate was added to download that (and other)
   certificate from the DC Master.
