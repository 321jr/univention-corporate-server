 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The UMC permissions "write" and "all" for shared folders did not
   contain the IMAP permission for expunge. A removal of mails or moving
   mails was not possible. This problem has been fixed and the permission
   will be updated automatically if the join script of
   univention-mail-dovecot is called.
