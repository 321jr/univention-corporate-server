fix: 1.0.1-2.54.201512151517
version: [4]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An error in the dovecot listener could lead to the unintended
   deletion of a shared folder if the corresponding LDAP objects is changed
   (Bug 40018).
 * The UMC permissions "write" and "all" for shared folders did not
   contain the IMAP permission for expunge. A removal of mails or moving
   mails was not possible. This problem has been fixed and the permission
   will be updated automatically if the join script of
   univention-mail-dovecot is called (Bug 40037).
 * IMAP ACLs removed through the Management Console, did not get
   removed on the IMAP server (Bug 40195).
