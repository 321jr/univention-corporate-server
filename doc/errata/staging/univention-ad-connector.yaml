 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The setup wizard's function to determine the LDAP bind DN for
   the given connector user now searches for the LDAP bind DN.
 * Don't remove group members if the group exists on both sides 
   during the first sync.
 * The init-script has been fixed to check for an already running instance of
   the AD connector. The PID file is removed on shutdown. The 'status' action
   has been added, too.
 * A bug regarding computer objects during synchronisation of group
   memberships has been fixed.
