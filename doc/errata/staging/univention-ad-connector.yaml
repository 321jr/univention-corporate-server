fix: 10.0.1-21.483.201604261523
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The synchronization of the password hashes was implemented by using a 
   service which was installed on the Microsoft Active Directory server. The
   Univention AD Connector now uses different interfaces of the Active
   Directory for reading and writing the password hashes. That means, the UCS
   AD Connector service which is installed on the Microsoft Active Directory
   server can be stopped after installing this update.
 * If a user was moved on UCS side, the group cache wasn't always updated and
   an error occurred. This issue has been fixed.
