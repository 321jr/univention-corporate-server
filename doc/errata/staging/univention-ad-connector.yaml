fix: 12.0.0-33A~4.3.0.201811221129
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The special cn=Subschema object caused AD-Connector rejects
 * Base64 encode non-printable attributes in univention-adsearch
 * Space separated attribute list as parameter in univention-adsearch
 * The Connector now updates the AD attribute userPrincipalName if the
   UCS username is changed (disabled for all updated systems, unset
   UCR variable connector/ad/mapping/sync/userPrincipalName and restart
   the AD-Connctor to sync username to userPrincipalName on subsequent
   object modifications)
