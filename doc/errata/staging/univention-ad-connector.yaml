desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The LDAP modification list can now be logged in case of a traceback
   if the changes are synchronized from UCS to Active Directory.
 * The lookup for the LDAP base DN of the Active Directory server has
   been fixed.
 * The AD-Connector can now handle `sync_mode` configuration on a per
   attribute granulatrity.
 * The samAccountName sycnhronization for Windows clients has been set
   to write only because a changed samAccountName attribute in Active
   Directory is handled via the CN synchronization.
 * The mapping for the MS-Exchange related attribute 'proxyAddresses'
   has been revised to synchonize the OpenLDAP attribute 'mailPrimaryAddress'
   with the default value configured in 'proxyAddresses'.
   In detail:
   1. When reading from Active Directory, the value with
   'SMTP:' prefix is now written to the OpenLDAP attribute
   'mailPrimaryAddress'. Before this update 'mailPrimaryAddress' used
   to be synchronized with the value of the Active Directory 'mail'
   attribute instead. The Active Directory 'mail' attribute has informative
   character.
   2. In the other direction, i.e. writing from OpenLDAP to Active Directory,
   the value of 'mailPrimaryAddress' continues to be written to the 'mail'
   attribute and now additionally gets written into the 'proxyAddresses'
   as default value, i.e. prefixed with 'SMTP:'.
   3. 'smtp:' prefixed values in 'proxyAddresses' continue to be synchronized
   with OpenLDAP 'mailAlternativeAddress'.
