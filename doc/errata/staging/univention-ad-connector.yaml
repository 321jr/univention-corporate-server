desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Ad-Connector is now able to sync kerberos hashes from the
   Active Directory to the UCS LDAP-Server. This can be enabled by
   setting the new UCR variable
   connector/ad/mapping/user/password/kerberos/enabled=true
   If this Variable is not set, the hashes will not be synced.
