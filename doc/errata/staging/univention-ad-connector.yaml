 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The LDAP modification list can now be logged in case of a traceback
   if the changes are synchronized from UCS to Active Directory.
 * The lookup for the LDAP base DN of the Active Directory server has
   been fixed.
 * The samAccountName sycnhronization for Windows clients has been set
   to write only because a changed samAccountName attribute in Active
   Directory is handled via the CN synchronization.
 * Revised mapping for MS-Exchange related 'proxyAddresses'
