desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * It is now possible to ignore bulks of users by setting
   the UCR variable connector/ad/mapping/user/ignorefilter to an LDAP filter.
   Every user that matches this LDAP filter will be ignored 
   by the connector.
 * Fix python library path in prepare-new-instance. This fixes the
   feature to synchronize several Active Directory domains with one
   UCS directory service
