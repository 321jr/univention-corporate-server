fix: 13.0.0-32A~4.4.0.202003081641
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The Ad-Connector is now able to sync kerberos hashes from the
   Active Directory to the UCS LDAP-Server. This can be enabled by
   setting the new UCR variable
   connector/ad/mapping/user/password/kerberos/enabled=true
   If this Variable is not set, the hashes will not be synced.
 * When syncing group members, the AD Connector now only
   adds/deletes the edited members instead of replacing the
   whole list of members in that group.
