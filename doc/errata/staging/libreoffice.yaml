 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Improvement to not throw more errors than neccessary (use the right error
   code) on WEBSERVICE() failures.
 * Do another replacement of FormulaError::NoValue to formula::errNoValue for
   clarity.
 * Backport from 5.4 branch to let FunctionAccess execute WEBSERVICE.
