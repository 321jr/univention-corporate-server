desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
   scripts can be executed on various document events such as mouse-over, etc.
   LibreOffice is typically also bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle
   vector graphics script, which can be manipulated into executing arbitrary
   Python commands. By using the document event feature to trigger LibreLogo
   to execute Python contained within a document a malicious document could be
   constructed which would execute arbitrary Python commands silently without
   warning. In the fixed versions, LibreLogo cannot be called from a document
   event handler. (CVE-2019-9848)
 * LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only documents from locations
   deemed 'trusted' are allowed to retrieve remote resources. This mode is not
   the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable
   LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw
   existed where bullet graphics were omitted from this protection.
