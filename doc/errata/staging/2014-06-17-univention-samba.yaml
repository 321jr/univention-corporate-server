src: univention-samba
fix: 8.0.18-3.468.201406171247
version: [2]
desc: |
    This updates fixes the following issues in univention-samba:
    * In Samba 3.6 and older the execution right in the ACL was not checked,
      so a client could execute a file even if it did not have execute rights 
      on the file. In Samba 4.0, this has been fixed. To re-establishing the
      old behaviour the new UCR variable samba/acl/allow/execute/always has
      been added (default True).
    * In addition four security vulnerabilities have been fixed:
      * Denial of service (infinite CPU loop) in nmbd
      * Denial of service (daemon crash) in the smbd file server daemon
      * Information leak in shadow_copy VFS module (not used in the default
        configuration)
      * Incorrect parsing of the require_membership_of option in Winbind
