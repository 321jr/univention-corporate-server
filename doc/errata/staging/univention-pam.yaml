 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The timelimit of ldap searches in libnss-ldap is now configurable
   via the UCR variable "nssldap/timelimit" and defaults to 30
   seconds. This prevents hanging UMC server processes when changing
   network and IP settings in certain circumstances.
