desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The PTR-Record entries are now sorted numerical in the overview of a reverse
   zone.
 * The DNS module now displays more information in the grid columns.
 * Forward zones are now shown before reverse zones.
 * Searching for a specific object type underneath of cn=univention in the
   LDAP directory did not yield results and has been repaired.
 * Searching for properties which require an exact match did not work because
   the LDAP filter was prepended with "*". The search for e.g. the gidNumber
   of a group is now possible again.
 * Searching for properties using the LDAPSearch syntax class caused a
   traceback.
