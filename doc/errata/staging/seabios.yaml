 This update addresses the following issue:
 * This is an update for the BIOS a virtual machine in UVMM uses. On reset
   the original BIOS code was not copied back completely, which could
   result in virtual machines getting stuck after reboots. In order for 
   virtual machines to load the updated BIOS, the virtual machine has to be
   shutdown and started again. A reboot does not suffice.
