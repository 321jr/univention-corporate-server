  This update fixes a bug in the configuration file parsing of the
  UCS 3.2 Samba winbind daemon, which caused trust relations to
  Windows Active Directory domains to fail (direction: UCS Samba
  NT domain trusts Windows AD domain).
  Now there is a new UCR variable samba/winbind/rpc/only.
  In UCS 3.2 Samba NT domains this needs to be set to "yes" to allow
  trusts relations to Microsoft Windows AD domains.
bug: [33303]
