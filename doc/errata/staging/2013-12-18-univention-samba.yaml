  This update fixes a bug in the configuration file parsing of the
  UCS 3.2-0 Samba winbind daemon, which caused trust relations to
  Windows Active Directory domains to fail (direction: UCS Samba
  NT domain trusts Windows AD domain).
  Now there is a new UCR variable samba/winbind/rpc/only.
  In UCS 3.2-0 Samba NT domains this needs to be set to "yes" to make
  trusts relations to Windows AD domains work.
bug: [33303]
