  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * This update fixes a bug in the configuration file parsing of the
    UCS 3.2-0 Samba winbind daemon, which caused trust relations to
    Windows Active Directory domains to fail (direction: UCS Samba
    NT domain trusts Windows AD domain).
    Now there is a new UCR variable samba/winbind/rpc/only.
    In UCS 3.2-0 Samba NT domains this needs to be set to "yes" to make
    trusts relations to Windows AD domains work.
  * The limit for the maximum number of open files has been increased 
    for all users.
bug: [33303, 32415]
