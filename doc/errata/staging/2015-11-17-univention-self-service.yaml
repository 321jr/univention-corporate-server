desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Regardless of the configured debug level, the token is now never
   written to a log file (Bug 39996).
 * Execute unjoin script, when removing package (Bug 39980).
 * Improved the security of redirecting a user (Bug 39981).
 * Remove links from overview website completely when uninstalling
   (Bug 40033).
 * Provide protection against denial of service attacks against server
   and users. Adds UCR variables umc/self-service/passwordreset/limit/.*
   to configure request limits. To see current request count and limits run
   /usr/lib/univention-self-service/univention-self-service-request-count
   (Bug 39720).
 * It was possible to scan for all known usernames in a domain, because the
   error message for providing an unknown username was different to those
   for users without available reset methods or wrong passwords (Bug 39939).
 * The sender address of token emails is now changable with the UCR variable
   umc/self-service/passwordreset/email/from_addr (Bug 40048).
 * It is now possible to use the passwort reset service with the primary
   email address instead of the username (Bug 40049).
