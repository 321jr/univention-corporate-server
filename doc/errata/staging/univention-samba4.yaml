fix: 6.0.10-36A~4.2.0.201710131504
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Add the scripts univention-samba-lockedout and univention-samba-unlock.
 * Support <interfaces/primary> as a keyword for the UCR variable 
   samba/interfaces has been added. Now, newly installed Samba 4
   systems will set samba/interfaces to lo and the primary interface
   which is represented via interfaces/primary. Thus, Samba will by
   default only listen on those two interfaces. This can be configured
   afterwards via samba/interfaces, samba/interfaces/bindonly and
   samba/register/exclude/interfaces.
 * Removed UCR-variable samba/logonscript
 * Added "name resolve order" to smb.conf; the Samba parameter
   "name resolve order" can now be set through UCS variable
   samba/name/resolve/order.
