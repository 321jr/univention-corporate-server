 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Don't fail join if CNF-Objects are in serverReferenceBL
 * Don't consider unreachable UCS@school Slave DCs for joining
 * Support uppercase CN: attribute in sysvol-cleanup.py
 * Adjust check_essential_samba4_dns_records.sh to change of behavior
   of the "host" command in UCS 4.2
 * The UCR variables samba/client/min/protocol, samba/min/protocol
   and samba/client/max/protocol have been added.
   Please be aware that raising samba/min/protocol e.g. to SMB2 also
   requires raising samba/client/max/protocol to that value or higher.
 * Make sysvol-sync.sh robust against varying stderr output from rsync.
 * Bump Samba dependency version and restart bind9 on upgrade.
