desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Add the scripts univention-samba-lockedout and univention-samba-unlock.
 * Support <interfaces/primary> as a keyword for the UCR variable 
   samba/interfaces has been added. Now, newly installed Samba 4
   systems will set samba/interfaces to lo and the primary interface
   which is represented via interfaces/primary. Thus, Samba will by
   default only listen on those two interfaces. This can be configured
   afterwards via samba/interfaces, samba/interfaces/bindonly and
   samba/register/exclude/interfaces.
 * sysvol-sync.sh now exits with exit code 1 when samba4/sysvol/sync/host
   can not be reached.
