 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The UCR variables samba/client/min/protocol, samba/min/protocol
   and samba/client/max/protocol have been added.
   Please be aware that raising samba/min/protocol e.g. to SMB2 also
   requires raising samba/client/max/protocol to that value or higher.
