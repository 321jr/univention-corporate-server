fix: 4.0.3-13.639.201601111717
version: [4]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The ACL check in the sysvol sync script is now limited
   to the Policies directory.
 * There are two new UCR variables samba4/sysvol/sync/from_upstream
   and samba4/sysvol/sync/from_downstream which can be used to deactivate
   copying files from other DCs.
 * The sysvol-sync script now checks if any changes need to be
   synchronized at all and it uses file locking to coordinate
   concurrent read and write processes.
