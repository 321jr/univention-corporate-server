  This update addresses the following issues:
  * On UCS@school Samba AD DC Slaves the univention-samba4 joinscript could
    take a long time to wait in vain for an object to get synchronized to
    the DC Master.
  * Some shell quoting errors have benn fixed.
  * Re-join during UCS@school Samba AD DC Slave setup could fail due to
    krb5.keytab containing differing Kerberos key hashes for the same key
    version number.
