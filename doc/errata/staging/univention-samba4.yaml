fix: 4.0.3-19.660.201604062045
desc: |
 This update sets the new smb.conf option 'ldap server require strong auth'
 to 'allow_sasl_over_tls'. Additionally it configures 'tls verify peer' to
 'ca_and_name'.

 The raised security requirements of Samba server components may require
 config adjustments for older clients. Univention Corporate Client (UCC) 1.0
 running a Linux kernel version prior to 3.8 for example require an adjustment
 of the mount.cifs options. In that case the value for mount option "sec"
 needs to be adjusted to "ntlmsspi", e.g. by setting

 ucr set ucc/mount/cifshome/options="serverino,sec=ntlmsspi"

 UCC 2.x clients (i.e. Linux kernel above 3.8) don't require this adjustment.
