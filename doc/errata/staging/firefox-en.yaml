 Firefox ESR 38.5.2 fixes these issues:
 * Mozilla Firefox allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
   Policy via data: and view-source: URIs (CVE-2015-7214).
 * Integer underflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
   or cause a denial of service via an MP4 video file with crafted covr
   metadata (CVE-2015-7222).
 * Integer overflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
   via a crafted MP4 video file (CVE-2015-7213).
 * Integer underflow might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive
   information, cause a denial of service by triggering a crafted WebRTC
   RTP packet (CVE-2015-7205).
 * Integer overflow allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
   triggering a graphics operation that requires a large texture
   allocation (CVE-2015-7212).
 * Use-after-free vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
   arbitrary code by triggering attempted use of a data channel that has
   been closed by a WebRTC function (CVE-2015-7210).
 * Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine allow remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
   code via unknown vectors (CVE-2015-7201).
