  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Entries and available languages on the UCS-overview aren't cached anymore.
  * This update corrects the generation of ucs-overview links. The links
    are now generated in the domain-joinscript. This ensures that
    host- and domain-identifiers match the current settings in case of
    a domain-rejoin and after completing the appliance setup.
