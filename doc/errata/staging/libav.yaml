 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Use-after-free vulnerability in the matroska_read_seek function
   (CVE-2014-7933)
 * Memory corruption in MJPEG (CVE-2014-8541)
 * Invalid memory access in MMVideo (CVE-2014-8543)
 * Invalid memory access in TIFF (CVE-2014-8544)
 * Invalid memory access in PNG (CVE-2014-8545)
 * Integer underflow in Cinepak (CVE-2014-8546)
 * Out of bounds access in GIF (CVE-2014-8547)
 * Off-by-one in the SMC (CVE-2014-8548)
 * Memory corruption in he VMD decoder (CVE-2014-9603)
 * Denial of service in the Ut Video decoder (CVE-2014-9604)
 * The seg_write_packet function in libavformat/segment.c in ffmpeg 2.1.4 and
   earlier does not free the correct memory location, which allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service ("invalid memory handler") and
   possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted video that triggers a use
   after free. (CVE-2014-9676)
 * The ff_mjpeg_decode_sof function in libavcodec/mjpegdec.c in Libav before
   0.8.18 does not validate the number of components in a JPEG-LS Start Of
   Frame segment, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   crafted Motion JPEG data (CVE-2015-1872)
 * The ff_h263_decode_mba function in libavcodec/ituh263dec.c in Libav before
   11.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero
   error and application crash) via a file with crafted dimensions
   (CVE-2015-5479)
 * The smka_decode_frame function in libavcodec/smacker.c does not verify that
   the data size is consistent with the number of channels, which allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Smacker data.
   (CVE-2015-8365)
 * remote cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files by using the concat
   protocol in an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file, leading to an external
   HTTP request in which the URL string contains the first line of a local
   file. (CVE-2016-1897)
 * remote cross-origin attacks and read arbitrary files by using the subfile
   protocol in an HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) M3U8 file, leading to an external
   HTTP request in which the URL string contains an arbitrary line of a local
   file. (CVE-2016-1898)
 * Integer overflow in the asf_write_packet function in libavformat/asfenc.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via a crafted PTS (aka presentation timestamp)
   value in a .mov file. (CVE-2016-2326)
 * memory corruption when parsing .mp4 files possibly leading to crash or
   arbitrary code execution (CVE-2016-3062)
 * The aac_sync function in libavcodec/aac_parser.c in Libav before 11.5 is
   vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow (CVE-2016-7393)
 * The put_no_rnd_pixels8_xy2_mmx function in x86/rnd_template.c in libav 11.7
   and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
   pointer dereference and crash) via a crafted MP3 file (CVE-2016-7424)
 * The h264 codec is vulnerable to various crashes with invalid-free, corrupted
   double-linked list or out-of-bounds read (No CVE assigned)
 * Multiple integer overflows have been discovered in libav 11.8 and earlier,
   allowing remote attackers to cause a crash via a crafted MP3 file
   (CVE-2016-9819 CVE-2016-9820 CVE-2016-9821 CVE-2016-9822)
 * The decode_residual function in libavcodec allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (buffer over-read) or obtain sensitive information from
   process memory via a crafted h264 video file. (CVE-2017-7208)
 * FFmpeg before 2017-02-07 has an out-of-bounds write caused by a heap-based
   buffer overflow related to the decode_frame function in
   libavcodec/pictordec.c. (CVE-2017-7862)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in the decode_dds1 function in libavcodec/dfa.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9992)
