 * 
 TEMP-0905332-CB57BF is resolved

 1.7.2-3+deb8u1 (Sun, 05 Aug 2018 20:01:03 +0200) * [109db8e] New patch: Default KeyInfo resolver doesn't check for empty element content. The Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ library contained a number of code paths at risk of dereferencing null pointers when processing various kinds of malformed KeyInfo hints typically found in signed or encrypted XML. The usual effect is a crash, and in the case of the Shibboleth SP software, a crash in the shibd daemon. Upstream bug: https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SANTUARIO/issues/SANTUARIO-491 CVE: not assigned yet Thanks to Scott Cantor * [4dafdb4] Replace Russ in Uploaders
bug: [47522]
