version: [2]
desc: |
 Change UNIVENTION_NTP Nagios check to compare NTP server time by
 using the 'check_ntp_time plugin'. The previous check also queried
 NTP server configuration options, which are not relevant for
 this check and, since UCS 3.2 errata 20, are not allowed to be queried
 from external sources.
