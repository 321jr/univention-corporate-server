  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The handling of DNS timeouts in univention-ad-takeover has been improved 
  * The sync mode is now configurable through UCR. for every connector property 
    (such as users, groups, containers etc.)
  * A problem in the handling of non-English user and group names was fixed
    in univention-ad-takeover. If the well known users and groups in AD are
    found to be non-English during takeover, the corresponding objects will be
    renamed in UCS to match.
  * Added support for synchronisation of MS WMI filters (disabled by default).
  * The internal connector status database is now removed when re-joining
    the system.
