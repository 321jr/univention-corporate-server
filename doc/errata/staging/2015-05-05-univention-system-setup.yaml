version: [1]
desc: |
  This errata update addresses the following issues:
  * Cleanup scripts will now be executed if setup-join.sh is called
    from the command line
  * The setup script 05_role/10role has been sped up. It no longer
    copies packages into the dpkg cache, but creates hardlinks
  * Improved logging when running setup-join: run-parts now prints
    filenames
