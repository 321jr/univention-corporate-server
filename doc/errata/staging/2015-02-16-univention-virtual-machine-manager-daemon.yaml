version: [4]
desc: |
  The list of virtual machines now refreshes automatically in the UMC grid
  when leaving the detail page of a virtual machine (as actions taken there
  can influence the state of the machine). Also, the UCR variable
  uvmm/umc/autosearch now only prevents the very first search on startup;
  manually clicking on the tree on the left refreshes the list even when
  autosearch is disabled.
  Additionally, the grid is updated non-invasively at a configurable
  interval (new UCR variable uvmm/umc/autoupdate/interval).
