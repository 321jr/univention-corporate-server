 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
   logon to the infrastructure where MySQL Server executes to compromise MySQL
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of
   MySQL Server. (CVE-2018-2755)
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2761)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2819)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2818)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2817)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read
   access to a subset of MySQL Server accessible data. (CVE-2018-2813)
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2018-2771)
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   logon to the infrastructure where MySQL Server executes to compromise MySQL
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of
   MySQL Server. (CVE-2018-2773)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
