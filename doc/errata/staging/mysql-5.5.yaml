 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows high privileged attacker with
   logon to the infrastructure where MySQL Server executes to compromise MySQL
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   access to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Server accessible
   data. (CVE-2017-10268)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update,
   insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data.
   (CVE-2017-3651)
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update,
   insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data.
   (CVE-2017-3653)
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update,
   insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data as well as
   unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Server accessible data.
   (CVE-2017-3652)
 * Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Connectors.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Connectors. Note: The documentation has also been updated for the correct
   way to use mysql_stmt_close(). Please see:

   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2017-3648)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2017-10384)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access
   to critical data or complete access to all MySQL Server accessible data.
   (CVE-2017-10379)
 * Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with
   network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server.
   Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
   to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL
   Server. (CVE-2017-10378)

   to the infrastructure where MySQL Server executes to compromise MySQL
   Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
   update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Server accessible data as
   well as unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Server accessible
   data and unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial
   DOS) of MySQL Server. (CVE-2017-3636)
