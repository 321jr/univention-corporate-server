desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Denial of service in regexp processing (CVE-2013-7422)
 * ambiguous environment variables handling (CVE-2016-2381)
 * Some modules in Perl 5.x do not properly remove . (period) characters from
   the end of the includes directory array, which might allow local users to
   gain privileges via a Trojan horse module under the current working
   directory. (CVE-2016-1238)
 * The XSLoader::load method in XSLoader in Perl does not properly locate .so
   files when called in a string eval, which might allow local users to
   execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse library under the current working
   directory. (CVE-2016-6185)
