 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The mapping of syntax classes to UMC widgets is now extendable via the
   UCR variable group "directory/manager/web/widget/.*/".
 * In some cases ldap operations against a broken ldap connection were done
   which lead to "LDAP connection invalid" error messages. In that case the
   operation is executed again with a new ldap connection.
 * The notification for successfully creating a user or computer now appears
   under the wizard dialog.
