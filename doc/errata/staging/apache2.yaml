desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the
   Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when
   verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the
   charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a
   two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is
   truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an
   out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of
   the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash
   which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case,
   this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect
   at all. (CVE-2017-15710)
 * The expression specified in <FilesMatch> could match '$' to a newline
   character in a malicious filename, rather than matching only the end of the
   filename. This could be exploited in environments where uploads of some
   files are are externally blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion
   of the filename. (CVE-2017-15715)
 * When mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI
   applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user may influence
   their content by using a "Session" header. This comes from the
   "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward its data to
   CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP Server to
   pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications. (CVE-2018-1283)
 * A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server due
   to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP
   header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to
   trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified
   as low risk for common server usage. (CVE-2018-1301)
 * A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP
   Server due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in
   shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users
   of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since
   mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by
   this vulnerability. (CVE-2018-1303)
 * When generating an HTTP Digest authentication challenge, the nonce sent to
   prevent reply attacks was not correctly generated using a pseudo-random
   seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest authentication
   configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across servers by an
   attacker without detection. (CVE-2018-1312)
