fix: 2.4.10-10+deb8u11A~4.2.3.201801251012
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process
   memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if
   httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. (CVE-2017-9798)
 * In Apache use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party modules outside
   of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being
   bypassed. (CVE-2017-3167)
 * mod_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call
   ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port.
   (CVE-2017-3169)
 * The HTTP strict parsing changes introduced a bug in token list parsing,
   which allows ap_find_token() to search past the end of its input string. By
   maliciously crafting a sequence of request headers, an attacker may be able
   to cause a segmentation fault, or to force ap_find_token() to return an
   incorrect value. (CVE-2017-7668)
 * mod_session_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured
   ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by
   default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This
   made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.
   (CVE-2016-0736)
 * mod_mime can read one byte past the end of a buffer when sending a
   malicious Content-Type response header. (CVE-2017-7679)
 * Apache was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in
   response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented
   a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or
   interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or
   using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling,
   response splitting and cache pollution. (CVE-2016-8743)
 * The value placeholder in [Proxy-]Authorization headers of type 'Digest' was
   not initialized or reset before or between successive key=value assignments
   by mod_auth_digest. Providing an initial key with no '=' assignment could
   reflect the stale value of uninitialized pool memory used by the prior
   request, leading to leakage of potentially confidential information, and a
   segfault in other cases resulting in denial of service. (CVE-2017-9788)
 * Malicious input to mod_auth_digest can cause the server to crash, and each
   instance continues to crash even for subsequently valid requests.
   (CVE-2016-2161)
 * Activate mod_reqtimeout in new installs and during updates from before
   2.4.10-10+deb8u8. It was wrongly not activated in new installs since
   jessie. This made the default installation vulnerable to some DoS attacks.
