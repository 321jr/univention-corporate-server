src: apache2
fix: 2.2.22-13.87.201603211937
version: [4]
desc: |
 The following issues have been fixed in apache2:
  * HTTP request smuggling attack against chunked request parser, allowing
    cache poisoning or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in
    use (CVE-2015-3183)
  * Don't limit default DH parameters to 1024 bits. This may cause problems
    with some Java based clients. A work-around is to configure these client
    not to use DHE key exchange but use ECDHE or RSA instead. A server-side
    work-around that limits the DH parameters to 1024 bits for all clients is
    described at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/ssl/ssl_faq.html#javadh
  * Backport support for adding DH parameters to the SSLCertificateFile
