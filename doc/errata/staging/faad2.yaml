desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * There was a heap-based buffer overflow in the function excluded_channels()
   in libfaad/syntax.c. (CVE-2018-19502)
 * There was a stack-based buffer overflow in the function calculate_gain() in
   libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c. (CVE-2018-19503)
 * There is a NULL pointer dereference in ifilter_bank() in
   libfaad/filtbank.c. (CVE-2018-19504)
 * There is a stack-based buffer underflow in the third instance of the
   calculate_gain function in libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c. A crafted input will lead
   to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact because
   limiting the additional noise energy level is mishandled for the G_max <= G
   case. (CVE-2018-20194)
 * A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ic_predict of
   libfaad/ic_predict.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and
   application crash, which leads to denial of service. (CVE-2018-20195)
 * There is a stack-based buffer underflow in the third instance of the
   calculate_gain function in libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c. A crafted input will lead
   to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact because
   limiting the additional noise energy level is mishandled for the G_max > G
   case. (CVE-2018-20197)
 * A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of
   libfaad/filtbank.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and
   application crash, which leads to denial of service because adding to
   windowed output is mishandled in the LONG_START_SEQUENCE case.
   (CVE-2018-20198)
 * A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in sbr_process_channel of
   libfaad/sbr_dec.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and
   application crash. (CVE-2018-20357)
 * An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in the lt_prediction
   function of libfaad/lt_predict.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation
   fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.
   (CVE-2018-20358)
 * An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in the
   sbrDecodeSingleFramePS function of libfaad/sbr_dec.c. The vulnerability
   causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of
   service. (CVE-2018-20359)
 * An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in the hf_assembly
   function of libfaad/sbr_hfadj.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation
   fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service.
   (CVE-2018-20361)
 * A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of
   libfaad/filtbank.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and
   application crash because adding to windowed output is mishandled in the
   EIGHT_SHORT_SEQUENCE case. (CVE-2018-20362)
 * The faad_resetbits function in libfaad/bits.c is affected by a buffer
   overflow vulnerability. The number of bits to be read is determined by
   ld->buffer_size - words*4, cast to uint32. If ld->buffer_size - words*4 is
   negative, a buffer overflow is later performed via
   getdword_n(&ld->start[words], ld->bytes_left). (CVE-2019-15296)
