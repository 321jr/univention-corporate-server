 * In PHP through 5.6.33, 7.0.x before 7.0.28, 7.1.x through 7.1.14, and 7.2.x through 7.2.2, there is a stack-based buffer under-read while parsing an HTTP response in the php_stream_url_wrap_http_ex function in ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c. This subsequently results in copying a large string. (CVE-2018-7584)
 * An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.35, 7.0.x before 7.0.29, 7.1.x before 7.1.16, and 7.2.x before 7.2.4. Dumpable FPM child processes allow bypassing opcache access controls because fpm_unix.c makes a PR_SET_DUMPABLE prctl call, allowing one user (in a multiuser environment) to obtain sensitive information from the process memory of a second user's PHP applications by running gcore on the PID of the PHP-FPM worker process. (CVE-2018-10545)
 * An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. An infinite loop exists in ext/iconv/iconv.c because the iconv stream filter does not reject invalid multibyte sequences. (CVE-2018-10546)
 * An issue was discovered in ext/phar/phar_object.c in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. There is Reflected XSS on the PHAR 403 and 404 error pages via request data of a request for a .phar file. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-5712. (CVE-2018-10547)
 * An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. ext/ldap/ldap.c allows remote LDAP servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) because of mishandling of the ldap_get_dn return value. (CVE-2018-10548)
 * An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.36, 7.0.x before 7.0.30, 7.1.x before 7.1.17, and 7.2.x before 7.2.5. exif_read_data in ext/exif/exif.c has an out-of-bounds read for crafted JPEG data because exif_iif_add_value mishandles the case of a MakerNote that lacks a final '\0' character. (CVE-2018-10549)
