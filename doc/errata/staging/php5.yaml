 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Denial of service due to crash of the phar extension caused
   by NULL pointer dereference when processing tar archives containing
   links referring to non-existing files. (CVE-2015-7803)
 * Denial of service and potential information disclosure due to
   the phar extension incorrectly processing directory entries found
   in archive files with the name "/". (CVE-2015-7804)
 * The file_check_mem function in funcs.c in file before 5.23, as used
   in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.5.34, mishandles
   continuation-level jumps, which allows context-dependent attackers to
   cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or
   possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted magic file (CVE-2015-8865)
 * libxml_disable_entity_loader setting is shared between threads
   ext/libxml/libxml.c in PHP before 5.5.22, when PHP-FPM is used, does not
   isolate each thread from libxml_disable_entity_loader changes in other
   threads, which allows remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity
   (XXE) and XML Entity Expansion (XEE) attacks via a crafted XML document,
   a related issue to CVE-2015-5161 (CVE-2015-8866)
 * main/php_open_temporary_file.c in PHP before 5.5.28 does not ensure
   thread safety, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (race condition and heap memory corruption) by leveraging
   an application that performs many temporary-file accesses (CVE-2015-8878)
 * The odbc_bindcols function in ext/odbc/php_odbc.c in PHP before 5.6.12
   mishandles driver behavior for SQL_WVARCHAR columns, which allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) in
   opportunistic circumstances by leveraging use of the odbc_fetch_array
   function to access a certain type of Microsoft SQL Server table
   (CVE-2015-8879)
 * Integer overflow in the php_raw_url_encode function in ext/standard/url.c
   in PHP before 5.5.34 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (application crash) via a long string to the rawurlencode function
   (CVE-2016-4070)
 * Format string vulnerability in the php_snmp_error function in
   ext/snmp/snmp.c in PHP before 5.5.34 allows remote attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via format string specifiers in an SNMP::get call
   (CVE-2016-4071)
 * The Phar extension in PHP before 5.5.34 allows remote attackers to
   execute arbitrary code via a crafted filename, as demonstrated by
   mishandling of \0 characters by the phar_analyze_path function in
   ext/phar/phar.c (CVE-2016-4072)
 * Multiple integer overflows in the mbfl_strcut function in
   ext/mbstring/libmbfl/mbfl/mbfilter.c in PHP before 5.5.34 allow remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
   execute arbitrary code via a crafted mb_strcut call (CVE-2016-4073)
 * The phar_make_dirstream function in ext/phar/dirstream.c in PHP before
   5.6.18 mishandles zero-size ././@LongLink files, which allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TAR archive
   (CVE-2016-4343)
 * The bcpowmod function in ext/bcmath/bcmath.c in PHP before 5.5.35 accepts
   a negative integer for the scale argument, which allows remote attackers
   to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact
   via a crafted call (CVE-2016-4537)
 * The xml_parse_into_struct function in ext/xml/xml.c in PHP before 5.5.35
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer under-read
   and segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   crafted XML data in the second argument, leading to a parser level of
   zero (CVE-2016-4539)
 * The grapheme_strpos function in ext/intl/grapheme/grapheme_string.c in
   PHP before 5.5.35 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
   negative offset (CVE-2016-4540, CVE-2016-4541)
 * The exif_process_* function in ext/exif/exif.c in PHP before 5.5.35 does
   not validate IFD sizes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact
   via crafted header data (CVE-2016-4542, CVE-2016-4543, CVE-2016-4544)
 * Absence of null character causes unexpected zend_string length and
   leaks heap memory. The test script uses locale_get_primary_language
   to reach get_icu_value_internal but there are some other functions
   that also trigger this issue: locale_canonicalize, locale_filter_matches,
   locale_lookup, locale_parse (CVE-2016-5093)
 * Don't create strings with lengths outside int range
   (CVE-2016-5094, CVE-2016-5095)
 * Type (int/size_t) confusion in fread (CVE-2016-5096)
 * Use After Free Vulnerability in WDDX Packet Deserialization
   (Debian bug 70661)
 * Type Confusion Vulnerability in PHP_to_XMLRPC_worker()
   (Debian bug 70728)
 * Session WDDX Packet Deserialization Type Confusion Vulnerability
   (Debian bug 70741)

   (Debian bug 70480)
 * An invalid free may occur under certain conditions when processing
   phar-compatible archives (CVE-2016-4473)
 * Remote denial of service or unspecified other impact via crafted call
   to the bcpowmod function in ext/bcmath/bcmath.c (CVE-2016-4538)
 * sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_log.c misinterprets the semantics of the snprintf
   return value, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information
   from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read
   and buffer overflow) via a long string, as demonstrated by a long URI
   in a configuration with custom REQUEST_URI logging (CVE-2016-5114)
 * Improper error handling in bzread (CVE-2016-5399)
 * Double free vulnerability in the _php_mb_regex_ereg_replace_exec
   function in php_mbregex.c in the mbstring extension allows remote
   attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
   (application crash) by leveraging a callback exception (CVE-2016-5768)
 * Multiple integer overflows in mcrypt.c in the mcrypt extension allow
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
   overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted length value, related to the (1) mcrypt_generic
   and (2) mdecrypt_generic functions (CVE-2016-5769)
 * Integer overflow in the SplFileObject::fread function spl_directory.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have

   (CVE-2016-5771)
 * Double free vulnerability in the php_wddx_process_data function in
   wddx.c in the WDDX extension allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
   crafted XML data that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call
   (CVE-2016-5772)
 * php_zip.c in the zip extension improperly interacts with the
   unserialize implementation and garbage collection, which allows
   remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
   service (use-after-free and application crash) via crafted serialized
   data containing a ZipArchive object (CVE-2016-5773)
 * Integer overflow in the virtual_file_ex function in
   TSRM/tsrm_virtual_cwd.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via a crafted extract operation on a ZIP archive
   (CVE-2016-6289)

   (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a 
   call with a long argument (CVE-2016-6294)
 * ext/snmp/snmp.c improperly interacts with the unserialize implementation
   and garbage collection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (use-after-free and application crash) or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data, a related issue
   to CVE-2016-5773 (CVE-2016-6295)
