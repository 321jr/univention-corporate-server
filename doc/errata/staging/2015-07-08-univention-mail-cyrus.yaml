fix: 7.0.1-6
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
     * Add UCR variable mail/cyrus/imap/allowplaintext to (dis)allow plain
       text passwords over non-TLS connections. Defaults to "no".
       Attention: This changes the previous default behaviour! Plain text
       authentication over unencrypted connections is now disabled by
       default. To revert to the old behaviour set
       mail/cyrus/imap/allowplaintext=yes (Bug #38500).
     * Several changes related to dovecot integration (Bug #38479, #38707)
     * The UDM module policies/mailquota has been moved to the package
	   univention-mail-cyrus. The UDM module will only be available if the
	   UCS mail stack with cyrus is installed. No change in behaviour
	   (Bug #38473).
