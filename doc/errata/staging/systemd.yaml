 * 232-25+deb9u8 (Tue, 15 Jan 2019 10:59:43 +0100) * Non-maintainer upload by
   the Security Team. * Address memory leak in dispatch_message_real() In
   dispatch_message_real() memory allocated by set_iovec_field_free() is not
   free()d. Follow upstream and introduce specific variables cmdline1 and
   cmdline2 and free() those automatically when dispatch_message_real()
   returns. * Correctly allocate core_timestamp on the heap and avoid invalid
   free() * Remove unused core* variables in process_kernel()
