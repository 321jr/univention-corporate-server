 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The start of the LDAP server has a timeout value to prevent deadlocks and
   allow monitoring solutions to log failed start attempts. That value was
   made configurable, because the necessary time depends on the number of
   domains. The variable is called dns/timeout-start.
bug: [50662]
