fix: 8.0.33-39.466.201404221525
note: 
version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The S4 connector python modules are only built for Python 2.6
  * The pcpatch user is no longer ignored by default
  * The start of multiple S4 connector instances is now prevented
  * While creating a user in UCS a stronger password is used which
    fulfill the password complexity settings
  * The entryUUID of deleted objects in OpenLDAP is now saved to a
    local cache. This will prevent a recreation of deleted objects.
  * The synchronization has been changed to a diff based algorithm.
  * The UCR variable connector/s4/listener/disabled has been added.
    If it is set to true the listener does not write any changes.
    This is helpful on a domain controller backup. The variable is
	not set by default during this upgrade.
