desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Rejects for DNs containing non-ASCII characters could not be saved,
   because python-sqlite3 doesn't accept UTF-8, causing rejects not to be
   visible but keeping the S4-Connector retrying endlessly, flooding the
   logs with rejects.
bug: [44369]
