fix: 9.0.16-58.605.201601201500
version: [4]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Wildcard DNS records didn't get synchronized any more.
 * Erratum 380 accidentally set connector/s4/listener/disabled=true on
   UCS Samba/AD DCs which run an S4 Connector in an UCS domain where
   multiple S4 Connector services are registered in LDAP. This may affect
   a DC Master in an UCS@school environment. This doesn't affect
   UCS Samba/AD DCs where connector/s4/allow/secondary is true, which comprises
   UCS@school Samba AD DC Salve systems.
