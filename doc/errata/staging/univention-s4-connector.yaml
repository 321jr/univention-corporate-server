fix: 12.0.2-19A~4.3.0.201806041530
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In case `connector/s4/mapping/group/syncmode` is set to "write" in UCR,
   the S4-Connector would still modify groups in OpenLDAP when a user
   was modified. This affected UCS@school.
 * Rejects for non-ascii Samba/AD accounts are not handled properly due
   to sqlite encoding problem. This has been fixed.
 * The listener module now restarts the connector if extended attributes
   are modified.
 * Added support for option `--bindpwdfile` during join.
 * When objects are deleted or moved remove the their DN from
   both group member mapping caches. This affected UCS@school.
