fix: 10.0.1-17.616.201608021822
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Allow recreation of object deleted in Samba/AD if visible in OpenLDAP
 * Allow recreation of account deleted in Samba/AD if objectSid matches
 * UCS@school: When an object gets moved out of visibility
   for an UCS@school Samba/AD PDC Slave attributes passed to
   the S4-Connector were mixed up. This caused the next object modified
   to be marked internally as deleted by the S4-Connector, while it is
   perfectly healthy in fact. While this update fixes the issue, manual
   steps are be required to unmark the objects and restore normal sync.
