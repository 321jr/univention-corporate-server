desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * univention-s4-connector now recommends univention-nagios-s4-connector.
 * The synchronization failed if a removed user was recreated at a
   different position. This issue has been fixed.
 * msPrint-ConnectionPolicy objects are now synced if the UCR
   variable connector/s4/mapping/msprintconnectionpolicy is set to true
   (the s4 connector has to be restarted after changing this UCR variable).
   This is required for UCS@school and will be set there accordingly.
