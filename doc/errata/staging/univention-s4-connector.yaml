fix: 10.0.4-12.637.201705021754
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Add new UCR variables
   `connector/s4/mapping/{gpo,wmifilter,msprintconnectionpolicy}/syncmode`.
 * Fix handling of Printer-Admins and searching for conflicting deleted
   objects by objectsid.
 * Rejects for DNs containing non-ASCII characters could not be saved,
   because python-sqlite3 doesn't accept UTF-8, causing rejects not to be
   visible but keeping the S4-Connector retrying endlessly, flooding the
   logs with rejects.
