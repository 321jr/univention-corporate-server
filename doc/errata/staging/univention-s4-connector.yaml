fix: 12.0.2-17A~4.3.0.201806040804
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Add support for DNS NS records
 * In case connector/s4/mapping/group/syncmode is set to "write" in UCR,
   the S4-Connector would still modify groups in OpenLDAP when a user
   was modified. This affected UCS@school.
 * Rejects for non-ascii Samba/AD accounts are not handled properly due
   to sqlite encoding problem. This has been fixed.
 * The listener module now restarts the connector if extended attributes
   are modified.
 * Added support for bindpwdfile during join.
