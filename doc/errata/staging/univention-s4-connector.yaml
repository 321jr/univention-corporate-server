fix: 13.0.2-16A~4.4.0.201906131317
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A trivial ucr syntax error has been fixed in the joinscript
 * Remove lockingdb and s4cache during re-join
 * When the S4-Connector starts, it logged the group cache initialization
   at level INFO. In debugging situations that can lead to a lot of output
   in connector-s4.log which ist hard to scroll. The log volume of the 
   group cache init has been lowered to log level ALL.
 * The scripts remove_ucs_rejected.py and remove_s4_rejected.py now
   escapes SQL syntax.
