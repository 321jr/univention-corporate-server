desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When the S4-Connector starts, it logged the group cache initialization
   at level INFO. In debugging situations that can lead to a lot of output
   in connector-s4.log which ist hard to scroll. The log volume of the 
   group cache init has been lowered to log level ALL.
