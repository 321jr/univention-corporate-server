version: [2]
desc: |
    This updates fixes the following issues in univention-samba4:
    * In Samba 3.6 and older the execution right in the ACL was not checked,
      so a client could execute a file even if it did not have execute rights 
      on the file. In Samba 4.0, this has been fixed. To re-establishing the
      old behaviour the new UCR variable samba/acl/allow/execute/always has
      been added (default True).
    * The univention-samba4 join script now always cleans up the samba
      private directory before the join and if the samba4 join fails, the
      join is aborted .
    * A typo in univention-samba4-backup has been fixed.
