desc: |
  Improve Postfix configuration:
  * Allow Postfix to receive client mails on submission port 587.
  * Exclude RC4 Cipher Suites from all TLS security levels (RFC7465).
    Adds UCR variables mail/postfix/tls/client/exclude_ciphers and
    mail/postfix/smtpd/tls/exclude_ciphers and sets them by default to
    "RC4, aNULL" (thanks to Lutz Willek).
  * Allow to set TLS/SSL settings for server and client. Disables SSLv3 for
    fresh installs, except for receiving mails. Adds UCR variables
    mail/postfix/smtpd/tls/*protocols and mail/postfix/tls/client/*protocols
    (thanks to Lutz Willek).
  * Add options to check IP-FQDN-mapping to fight spam. Adds UCR variables
    mail/postfix/smtpd/restrictions/sender/require_reverse_dns and
    mail/postfix/smtpd/restrictions/sender/require_forward-confirmed_reverse_dns
    for weaker and stricter reverse DNS checking respectively.
