  Improve Postfix configuration:
  * Allow Postfix to receive client mails on submission port 587.
  * Allow to set TLS/SSL settings for server and client. Disables SSLv3 for
  fresh installs, except for receiving mails. Adds UCR variables
  mail/postfix/smtpd/tls/*protocols and mail/postfix/tls/client/*protocols
  (thanks to Lutz Willek).
