fix: 3.1.8-0+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Rewrite debian/postfix-instance-generator to avoid use of postmulti to fix
   failures when inet_interfaces != all.
 * DANE support. Postfix builds with OpenSSL 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 failed to send
   email to some sites with "TLSA 2 X X" records associated with an
   intermediate CA certificate.
 * Missing dynamicmaps support in the Postfix sendmail command broke
   authorized_submit_users with a dynamically-loaded map type.
 * Do not log warnings that some restriction returns OK, when the access map
   DISCARD feature is in effect.
 * The DB_CONFIG bugfix broke Berkeley DB configurations with a relative
   pathname.
 * Reportedly, some res_query(3) implementation can return -1 with h_errno==0.
   Instead of terminating with a panic, the Postfix DNS client now logs a
   warning and sets h_errno to TRY_AGAIN.
 * Missing mailbox seek-to-end error check in the local(8) delivery agent.
 * Incorrect mailbox seek-to-end error message in the virtual(8) delivery
   agent.
