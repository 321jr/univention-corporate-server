 This update addresses the following issues:
  * An obsolte cron job (/etc/cron.daily/amavisd-new) will be removed.
  * The new UCR variable mail/antispam/headertag can be used to define
    a string to prepend to subject header field for SPAM messages. 
    If the variable is unset (default), the subject is not modified.
