  This erratum update fixes several issues:
  * A VNC connection initiated from the Univention Directory Manager module
    can now be used immediately after the start of the virtual machine.
  * The automatic check script again restarts UVMMd in case the daemon is
    no longer responding to the cyclic liveness check.
