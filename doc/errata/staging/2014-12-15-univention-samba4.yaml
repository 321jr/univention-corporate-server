  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The default for the Samba print server architecture was 32 bit.
    Now the server architecture is taken as default to determine it.
    Additionally the smb.conf parameter "spoolss: architecture" can
    be adjusted manually by setting the new UCR variable
    "samba/spoolss/architecture" (see man smb.conf).
  * A potential issue during Samba3 to Samba4 inplace migration.
