fix: 2.46-10+deb8u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) before 2.49 uses temporary folder
   locations that allow unprivileged local users to overwrite files. This
   allows a local attack in which either a plugin or the uninstaller can be
   replaced by a Trojan horse program. (CVE-2015-9267)
 * Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) before 2.49 has unsafe implicit
   linking against Version.dll. In other words, there is no protection
   mechanism in which a wrapper function resolves the dependency at an
   appropriate time during runtime. (CVE-2015-9268)
