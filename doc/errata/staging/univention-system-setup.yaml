 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When joining into an Active Directory domain where an UCS system is already
   part of an dialog to replace this system is shown if that system is not
   reachable.
 * The detection of the domaincontroller master FQDN during the initial system
   configuration has been fixed if the nameserver is not the DC Master.
 * UCS appliances now check for a valid license before starting the join
   process.
 * Trying to join a system with a lower UCS version than the domaincontroller
   master is now detected early.
