 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A new option for setting up a UCS system has been added which allows a
   fast instantiation for demo purposes. Some more aspects of the setup
   process have been improved w.r.t. realiability and speed.
 * Some more corrections have been applied for the fast UCS instantiation.
 * Problems with a hanging setup process when finishing have been
   corrected.
 * The timeout for internal LDAP queries during changes of network
   configurations has been adjusted for the UCS setup process.
 * The rendering of the welcome screen after booting a UCS system has been
   improved and overlaying log messages have been removed.
 * Problems with a disabled repository after setup have been corrected.
 * An error dialog has been corrected which eventually showed up during
   the setup process stating that no module would be available.
 * A typo in the header for the initial setup of UCS on an
   Amazon EC2 instance has been corrected.
