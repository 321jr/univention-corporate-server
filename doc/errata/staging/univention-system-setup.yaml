desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The package now uses dh_python2 instead of python-support.
   Therefore python modules are installed into
   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/univention/management/console/modules/.
 * The minimum RAM requirements are now shown before starting the 
   UCS installation.
