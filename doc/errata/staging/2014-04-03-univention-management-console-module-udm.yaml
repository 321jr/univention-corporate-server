  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * The "Change password" module showed an endless loading animation after
    successfully applying changes. Now the form is properly reloading.
  * The labels for widgets regarding the type of LDAP objects have been changed
    as the old ones could not reflect the grammatical case.
