A new update is available for Univention Corporate Server 3.1 as
part of the extended security maintenance.
It addresses the following problem:

Program component:  ruby1.8
Reference:          CVE-2009-5147 CVE-2011-0188 CVE-2011-2686 CVE-2011-2705
                    CVE-2011-4815 CVE-2014-8080 CVE-2014-8090 CVE-2015-1855
Fixed version:      1.8.7.302-2.26.201606071458

The following issues were fixed:
* DL::dlopen could open a library with tainted library name (CVE-2009-5147)
* The VpMemAlloc function in bigdecimal.c in the BigDecimal class
  does not properly allocate memory, which allows context-dependent
  attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via vectors involving creation of a large
  BigDecimal value within a 64-bit process, related to an
  "integer truncation issue." (CVE-2011-0188)
* Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking,
  which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict
  the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number
  sequence obtained in a different child process (CVE-2011-2686)
* The SecureRandom.random_bytes function in lib/securerandom.rb
  relies on PID values for initialization, which makes it easier
  for context-dependent attackers to predict the result string
  by leveraging knowledge of random strings obtained in an earlier
  process with the same PID (CVE-2011-2705)
* Hash values computed without restricting the ability to trigger
  hash collisions predictably, allowing context-dependent attackers
  to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input
  to an application that maintains a hash table (CVE-2011-4815)
* The REXML parser allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (memory consumption) via a crafted XML document, aka an XML
  Entity Expansion (XEE) attack (CVE-2014-8080, CVE-2014-8090)
* OpenSSL extension hostname matching implementation violates RFC 6125
  (CVE-2015-1855)
