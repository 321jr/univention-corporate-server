 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2014-0033: prevent remote attackers from conducting session
   fixation attacks via crafted URLs.
 * CVE-2014-0119: Fix not properly constraining class loader that accesses
   the XML parser used with an XSLT stylesheet which allowed remote
   attackers to read arbitrary files via crafted web applications.
 * CVE-2014-0099: Fix integer overflow in
   java/org/apache/tomcat/util/buf/Ascii.java.
 * CVE-2014-0096: Properly restrict XSLT stylesheets that allowed remote
   attackers to bypass security-manager restrictions.
 * CVE-2014-0075: Fix integer overflow in the parseChunkHeader function in
   java/org/apache/coyote/http11/filters/ChunkedInputFilter.java.
 * CVE-2013-4590: prevent "Tomcat internals" information leaks.
 * CVE-2013-4322: prevent remote attackers from doing denial of service
   attacks.
 * CVE-2013-4286: reject requests with multiple content-length headers or
   with a content-length header when chunked encoding is being used.
 * Avoid CVE-2013-1571 when generating Javadoc.
 * CVE-2014-0227: Add error flag to allow subsequent attempts at reading after
   an error to fail fast.
 * CVE-2014-0230: Add support for maxSwallowSize.
 * CVE-2014-7810: Fix potential BeanELResolver issue when running under a
   security manager.  Some classes may not be accessible but may have
   accessible interfaces.
 * CVE-2015-5174: Directory traversal vulnerability in RequestUtil.java.
 * CVE-2015-5345: The Mapper component in Apache Tomcat before 6.0.45
   processes redirects before considering security constraints and Filters.
 * CVE-2016-0706: Apache Tomcat before 6.0.45 does not place
   org.apache.catalina.manager.StatusManagerServlet on the
   org/apache/catalina/core/RestrictedServlets.properties list which allows
   remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager
   restrictions.
 * CVE-2016-0714: The session-persistence implementation in Apache Tomcat
   before 6.0.45 mishandles session attributes, which allows remote
   authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions.
 * CVE-2016-0763: The setGlobalContext method in
   org/apache/naming/factory/ResourceLinkFactory.java in Apache Tomcat does
   not consider whether ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext callers are
   authorized, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended
   SecurityManager restrictions and read or write to arbitrary application
   data, or cause a denial of service (application disruption), via a web
   application that sets a crafted global context.
 * CVE-2015-5351: The Manager and Host Manager applications in
   Apache Tomcat establish sessions and send CSRF tokens for arbitrary new
   requests, which allows remote attackers to bypass a CSRF protection
   mechanism by using a token.
