fix: 2:4.10.1-1A~4.4.0.201904031509
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Update to Samba 4.10.2
 * Improve samba-tool ntacl sysvolcheck to reduce reporting false positives.
   This can be run by using new option --mask-msad-differences. Without
   the new option the reporting is unchanged. This is another step in the
   ongoing quest of improving the quality this tool for NTACL inheritence.
 * Fix mode of dns_update_list and spn_update_list, broken after provision
 * During the creation of a new Samba AD DC, files are created in the
   /var/lib/samba/private/ directory.
   During initial setup of a UCS domainctontroller with UCS 4.4 / Samba 4.10
   two files were created with mode 0666, that is world-writable, including
   the list of DNS names and servicePrincipalName values to update.
   Most UCS Samba DCs upgraded from UCS 4.3-3 or earlier however
   will not be affected by this, because the Bug was introduced with Samba 4.8
   while UCS 4.3 systems are running Samba 4.7.
   For details see https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-3870.html
 * Samba contains an RPC endpoint emulating the Windows registry service
   API. One of the requests, "winreg_SaveKey", is susceptible to a
   path/symlink traversal vulnerability. Unprivileged users can use it to
   create a new registry hive file anywhere they have unix permissions to
   create a new file within a Samba share. If they are able to create
   symlinks on a Samba share, they can create a new registry hive file
   anywhere they have write access, even outside a Samba share
   definition.
   Existing share restrictions such as "read only" or share ACLs
   do not prevent new registry hive files being written to the
   filesystem. A file may be written under any share definition wherever
   the user has unix permissions to create a file.
   Existing files cannot be overwritten using this vulnerability, only
   new registry hive files can be created, however the presence of
   existing files with a specific name can be detected.
   Samba writes or detects the file as the authenticated user, but
   by UCS default the "Administrator" account is mapped to root, because
   it is configured as "admin user" in smb.conf.
