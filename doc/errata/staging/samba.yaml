 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Samba not recognizing Unix-Sids as valid caused
   windows explorer crashes, when opening the security
   tab on a share where such Sids are found in the acls.
   We found several other SIDs which could trigger a crash
   and marked them as valid in Samba.
