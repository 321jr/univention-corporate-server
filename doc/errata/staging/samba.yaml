desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Samba not recognizing Unix-SIDs as valid caused crashes of the
   Microsoft Windows Explorer, when opening the security
   tab on a share or file where such SIDs are found in the ACLs.
   We found several other "well known" SIDs which could trigger a crash
   and declared them as valid in Samba.
 * TODO Bug #50715
bug: [50601, 50715]
