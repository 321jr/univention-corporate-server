 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A client combining the 'ASQ' and 'Paged Results' LDAP controls can cause a use-after-free
   in Samba's AD DC LDAP server (CVE-2020-10700).
 * A deeply nested filter in an un-authenticated LDAP search can exhaust the LDAP server's stack
   memory causing a crash of the Samba/AD LDAP server component (CVE-2020-10704).
