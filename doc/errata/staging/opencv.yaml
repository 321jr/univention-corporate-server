 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * 
 * OpenCV 3.0.0 has a double free issue that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2016-1516)
 CVE_2016-1517 is open
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds write error in the function FillColorRow1 in utils.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread. (CVE-2017-12597)
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds read error in the cv::RBaseStream::readBlock function in modules/imgcodecs/src/bitstrm.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread, as demonstrated by the 8-opencv-invalid-read-fread test case. (CVE-2017-12598)
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds read error in the function icvCvt_BGRA2BGR_8u_C4C3R when reading an image file by using cv::imread. (CVE-2017-12599)
 CVE_2017-12600 is open
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has a buffer overflow in the cv::BmpDecoder::readData function in modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_bmp.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread, as demonstrated by the 4-buf-overflow-readData-memcpy test case. (CVE-2017-12601)
 CVE_2017-12602 is open
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an invalid write in the cv::RLByteStream::getBytes function in modules/imgcodecs/src/bitstrm.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread, as demonstrated by the 2-opencv-heapoverflow-fseek test case. (CVE-2017-12603)
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds write error in the FillUniColor function in utils.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread. (CVE-2017-12604)
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds write error in the FillColorRow8 function in utils.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread. (CVE-2017-12605)
 * OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) through 3.3 has an out-of-bounds write error in the function FillColorRow4 in utils.cpp when reading an image file by using cv::imread. (CVE-2017-12606)
 * In modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, the length of buffer AutoBuffer _src is small than expected, which will cause copy buffer overflow later. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier. (CVE-2017-12862)
 * In opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, function PxMDecoder::readData has an integer overflow when calculate src_pitch. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier. (CVE-2017-12863)
 * In opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_pxm.cpp, function ReadNumber did not checkout the input length, which lead to integer overflow. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier. (CVE-2017-12864)
 * OpenCV 3.3.1 has a Buffer Overflow in the cv::PxMDecoder::readData function in grfmt_pxm.cpp, because an incorrect size value is used. (CVE-2017-17760)
 * In opencv/modules/imgcodecs/src/utils.cpp, functions FillUniColor and FillUniGray do not check the input length, which can lead to integer overflow. If the image is from remote, may lead to remote code execution or denial of service. This affects Opencv 3.3 and earlier. (CVE-2017-1000450)
 * In OpenCV 3.3.1, a heap-based buffer overflow happens in cv::Jpeg2KDecoder::readComponent8u in modules/imgcodecs/src/grfmt_jpeg2000.cpp when parsing a crafted image file. (CVE-2018-5268)
 * In OpenCV 3.3.1, an assertion failure happens in cv::RBaseStream::setPos in modules/imgcodecs/src/bitstrm.cpp because of an incorrect integer cast. (CVE-2018-5269)
 CVE_2018-7712 is open
 CVE_2018-7713 is open
 CVE_2018-7714 is open
