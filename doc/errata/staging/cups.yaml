desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 CVE_2014-8166 is open
 * A localhost.localdomain whitelist entry in valid_host() in scheduler/client.c in CUPS before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary IPP commands by sending POST requests to the CUPS daemon in conjunction with DNS rebinding. The localhost.localdomain name is often resolved via a DNS server (neither the OS nor the web browser is responsible for ensuring that localhost.localdomain is 127.0.0.1). (CVE-2017-18190)
 * The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in CUPS before 2.2.6, when D-Bus support is enabled, can be crashed by remote attackers by sending print jobs with an invalid username, related to a D-Bus notification. (CVE-2017-18248)
