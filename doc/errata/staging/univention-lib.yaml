desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Due to a logic error it could happen that not all LDAP-ACL registered in
   LDAP were active on newly installed domain controller backup systems.
   This could lead to information disclosure or replication errors. The
   error is now fixed and when updating the univention-ldap-server package,
   missing LDAP ACLs are automatically activated (Bug #48530).
 * Defines die() in ldap.sh
bug: [48530, 47424]
