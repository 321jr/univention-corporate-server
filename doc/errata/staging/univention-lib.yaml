 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The package now uses dh_python2 instead of python-support.
   Therefore python modules are installed into
   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/univention/lib/.
 * A path traversal vulnerability in the ldap_extension.py listener
   utilities has been fixed.
