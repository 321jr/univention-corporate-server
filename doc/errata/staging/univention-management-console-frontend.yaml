 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * It's now possible to use multiple languages in one session when using HTTP
   basic authentication (via command line).
 * The umc.store API allows to contain Arrays in query requests now.
 * An error in the comparision function umc.tools.cmpObjects which could cause
   that e.g. sorting the grid header wasn't possible anymore has been fixed.
 * The location where UMC redirects after logout is now configurable via the
   UCR variable "umc/logout/location".
