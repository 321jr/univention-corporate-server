 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The joinscript uses curl instead of wget to configure SAML service provider
   setting to prevent conflicts with old SHA1 or MD5 SSL certificates.
 * A unjoinscript has been added which removes the SAML configuration for UMC.
 * If error messages contained a "%" they weren't displayed in UMC.
