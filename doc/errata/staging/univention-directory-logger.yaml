 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * univention-directory-logger is now able to prefix related log
   lines with the same transaction ID. This new feature is
   automaticaly enabled on fresh installations of
   univention-directory-logger but remains disabled during
   updates. Set ldap/logging/id-prefix=yes to enable this
   feature manually (Bug #51082).
