fix: 7:3.2.14-1~deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The flv_write_packet function in libavformat/flvenc.c in FFmpeg through
   4.0.2 does not check for an empty audio packet, leading to an assertion
   failure. (CVE-2018-15822)
 * FFmpeg before commit 2b46ebdbff1d8dec7a3d8ea280a612b91a582869 contains a
   Buffer Overflow vulnerability in asf_o format demuxer that can result in
   heap-buffer-overflow that may result in remote code execution. This attack
   appears to be exploitable via specially crafted ASF file that has to be
   provided as input to FFmpeg. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed
   in 2b46ebdbff1d8dec7a3d8ea280a612b91a582869 and later. (CVE-2018-1999011)
 * denial of service in subtitle decoder allows attackers to hog CPU via
   crafted video file (CVE-2019-9718)
 * libavcodec/hevcdec.c in FFmpeg 4.1.2 mishandles detection of duplicate
   first slices, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (NULL pointer dereference and out-of-array access) or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via crafted HEVC data. (CVE-2019-11338)
