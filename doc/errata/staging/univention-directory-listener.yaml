fix: 10.0.0-18.335.201610141453
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The Listener now checks the file system for enough free space and aborts,
   if too few is available. The default of 10 MiB can be changed through the
   new UCR variable 'listener/freespace'.
 * The Listener now writes the state of each handler just after
   initialization.
 * For each changed LDAP entry the distinguished name is now logged with debug
   level 'PROCESS'.
 * Several quoting problems in the init and runit scripts have been fixed.
 * Build-hardening and more warnings have been enabled for the compiler. Error
   handling and logging have been improved.
