 This update addresses the following issue:
 * If the connection to the LDAP server is closed, it is now automatically
   re-connected. This fixes joining in large environments, when the LDAP
   server is restarted while a new system is joined.
   The number of re-tries can be configured through the new UCR variable
   'listener/ldap/retries'.
