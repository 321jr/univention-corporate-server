 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * It is now possible to navigate to an UMC module without the overview
   of all UMC modules and have only that UMC module open.
   This can be achieved for example with:
   https://fqdn/univention/management/#singlemodule=true&module=setup:network
 * Some preparations for future development have been made.
