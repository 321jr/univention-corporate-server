desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Crash on receipt of certain malformed DNS requests (CVE-2015-3294)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted
   DNS response (CVE-2017-14491)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted
   IPv6 router advertisement request (CVE-2017-14492)
 * Stack-based buffer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a
   crafted DHCPv6 request. (CVE-2017-14493)
 * When configured as a relay, dnsmasq allows remote attackers to
   obtain sensitive memory information via vectors involving handling
   DHCPv6 forwarded requests (CVE-2017-14494)
 * Memory leak, when the --add-mac, --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet option
   is specified, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (memory consumption) via vectors involving DNS response creation
   (CVE-2017-14495)
 * Integer underflow in the add_pseudoheader function, when the --add-mac,
   --add-cpe-id or --add-subnet option is specified, allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted DNS request
   (CVE-2017-14496)
