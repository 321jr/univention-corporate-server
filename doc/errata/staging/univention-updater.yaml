fix: 11.0.9-4.1447.201602231153
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The change from http:// to https:// breaks the old updater from UCS-4.0-4,
   which is still running after the update to 4.1-0. As such all updates stop
   there. Running the same command again continues installing updates, as then
   the new updater is used.
   This update fixes this problem by re-executing the updater after each
   update to guarantee, that the latest version is always used.
