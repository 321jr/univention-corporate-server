desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The temporary APT sources.list used for release updates is now removed, if
   any of the pre-update scripts signals an abort condition.
 * The check for QEMU virtual machines has been removed from the pre-update
   script.
 * Container updates for apps aren't displayed anymore as those are currently
   only supported through the Appcenter module.
