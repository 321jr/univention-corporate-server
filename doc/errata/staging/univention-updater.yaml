fix: 11.0.9-5.1464.201603230907
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The change from http:// to https:// breaks the old updater from UCS-4.0-4,
   which is still running after the update to 4.1-0. As such all updates stop
   there. Running the same command again continues installing updates, as then
   the new updater is used.
   This update fixes this problem by re-executing the updater after each
   update to guarantee, that the latest version is always used.
 * The "dists/**/Packages*" files created for local repositories did contain
   multiple entries for the same package. This breaks the Debian installer and
   other tools like "debootstrap", which use a simpler implementation than
   APT. A filter has been added to filter out old versions and duplicate
   entries.
