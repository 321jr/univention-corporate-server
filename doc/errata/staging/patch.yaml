 This update addresses the following issue(s):

 CVE_2018-6951 is open
 CVE_2018-6952 is open
 * GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when processing patch files, specifically the EDITOR_PROGRAM invocation (using ed) can result in code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via a patch file processed via the patch utility. This is similar to FreeBSD's CVE-2015-1418 however although they share a common ancestry the code bases have diverged over time. (CVE-2018-1000156)

 2.7.5-1+deb8u1 (Mon, 16 Apr 2018 20:48:14 +0000) * Fix CVE-2018-1000156: arbitrary command execution in ed-style patches
 .
 * CVE-2018-1000156 patch: Malicious patch files cause ed to execute arbitrary commands (CVE-2018-1000156)
 * The do_ed_script function in pch.c in GNU patch through 2.7.6, and patch in FreeBSD 10.1 before 10.1-RELEASE-p17, 10.2 before 10.2-BETA2-p3, 10.2-RC1 before 10.2-RC1-p2, and 0.2-RC2 before 10.2-RC2-p1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted patch file, because a '!' character can be passed to the ed program. (CVE-2015-1418)
