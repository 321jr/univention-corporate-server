desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Server NULL pointer dereference flaw in ClientCutText message handling
   (CVE-2014-6053)
 * Improper input sanitization in rfbProcessClientNormalMessage in rfbserver.c
   (CVE-2018-7225)
 * Infinite loop in VNC client code allows for denial of service
   (CVE-2018-20021)
 * Improper initialization in VNC client code allows for information
   disclosure (CVE-2018-20022)
 * TightVNC contains global buffer overflow in HandleCoRREBBP macro function,
   which can potentially result code execution. This attack appear to be
   exploitable via network connectivity. (CVE-2019-8287)
 * TightVNC contains heap buffer overflow in rfbServerCutText handler, which
   can potentially result code execution.. This attack appear to be
   exploitable via network connectivity. (CVE-2019-15678)
 * TightVNC contains heap buffer overflow in InitialiseRFBConnection function,
   which can potentially result code execution. This attack appear to be
   exploitable via network connectivity. (CVE-2019-15679)
 * TightVNC contains null pointer dereference in HandleZlibBPP function, which
   results Denial of System (DoS). This attack appear to be exploitable via
   network connectivity. (CVE-2019-15680)
 * LibVNC contains a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which allow an
   attacker to read stack memory and can be abused for information disclosure.
   Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory
   and bypass ASLR. This attack appear to be exploitable via network
   connectivity. These vulnerabilities have been fixed. (CVE-2019-15681)
