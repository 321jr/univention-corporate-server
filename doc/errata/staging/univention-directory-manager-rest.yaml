desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When accessing "http(s)://FQDN/univention/udm/schema/" or
   "http(s)://FQDN/univention/udm/openapi.json" authentication is now
   required by default. "ucr set directory/manager/rest/require-auth=no" can
   be used to disable this. After setting this UCR Variable the
   "univention-directory-manager-rest" service needs to be restarted.
