desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Fixed suggestion of FQDN build from value entered in the organization field
    in appliance mode.
  * Moved setup of apache startsite on EC2 to an earlier stage in the boot
    process.
  * Do not show Firefox data submission policy popup during system setup.
  * If an email address is given during the system setup the startup wizard
    will not ask for an activation address. This prevents a possible double
    registration.
  * The Windows NETBIOS domain name can now be up to 15 characters long.
  * Problems with reloading values and displaying messages after saving changes
    have been corrected.
  * The UMC now warns the user if DHCP is selected but a link-local IP address is used.
    This can occur if DHCP is preconfigured but no DHCP lease could be obtained.
