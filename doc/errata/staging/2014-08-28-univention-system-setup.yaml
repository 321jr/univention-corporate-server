  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Fix suggestion of FQDN build from value entered
    in the organization field in appliance mode
  * Moved setup of apache startsite on EC2 to an earlier
    stage in the boot process
  * Do not show Firefox data submission policy popup during
    system setup
  * If an email address is given during the system setup
    the startup wizard won't ask for an activation address.
    This prevents a possible double registration.
  * The Windows NETBIOS domain name can now be up to
    15 characters long.
