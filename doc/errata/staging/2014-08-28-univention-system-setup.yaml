    in the organization field in appliance mode
  * Moved setup of apache startsite on EC2 to an earlier
    stage in the boot process
  * Do not show Firefox data submission policy popup during
    system setup
  * If an email address is given during the system setup
    the startup wizard won't ask for an activation address.
