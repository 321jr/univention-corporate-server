  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Certain policies did not get a link to directly edit them when opening the
    "Policies" tab of LDAP objects. Fixed that.
  * A user's empty mail server was overwritten with the first non-emtpy one
    even for existing users. Fixed that.
  * A typo in the German translation has been fixed.
  * After adding a new standard container the container was not selectable as
    position for new objects. Fixed that.
