   and Anatol Belski to keep up with security issues in PHP 5.6.40 after EOL.
   * Security Issues Fixed: + Core: - Fixed bug #77630 (rename() across the
   device may allow unwanted access during processing). + EXIF: - Fixed bug
   #77509 (Uninitialized read in exif_process_IFD_in_TIFF). - Fixed bug #77540
   (Invalid Read on exif_process_SOFn). - Fixed bug #77563 (Uninitialized read
   in exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE). - Fixed bug #77659 (Uninitialized read
   in exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE). + PHAR: - Fixed bug #77396 (Null Pointer
   Dereference in phar_create_or_parse_filename). - Fixed bug #77586
   (phar_tar_writeheaders_int() buffer overflow). + SPL: - Fixed bug #77431
   (openFile() silently truncates after a null byte).
 * An issue was discovered in PHP before 7.1.27, 7.2.x before 7.2.16, and
   7.3.x before 7.3.3. Due to the way rename() across filesystems is
   implemented, it is possible that file being renamed is briefly available
   with wrong permissions while the rename is ongoing, thus enabling
   unauthorized users to access the data. (CVE-2019-9637)
 * An issue was discovered in the EXIF component in PHP before 7.1.27, 7.2.x
   before 7.2.16, and 7.3.x before 7.3.3. There is an uninitialized read in
   exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE because of mishandling the maker_note->offset
   relationship to value_len. (CVE-2019-9638)
 * An issue was discovered in the EXIF component in PHP before 7.1.27, 7.2.x
   before 7.2.16, and 7.3.x before 7.3.3. There is an uninitialized read in
   exif_process_IFD_in_MAKERNOTE because of mishandling the data_len variable.
