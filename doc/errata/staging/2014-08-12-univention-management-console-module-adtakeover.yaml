    * When running AD takeover out of AD member mode its necessary to flush samba caches
      to steer clear of IDMAP issues.
    * If the spelling case of the domain name differs between AD and UCS the GPO check failed.
      This has been fixed now by creating the symbolic link in the sysvol share.
