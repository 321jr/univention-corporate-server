desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. A
   dereference of a NULL pointer may occur. This pointer is returned by the
   OpenSSL sk_X509_REVOKED_value() function when encountering an empty CRL
   installed by a system administrator. The dereference occurs when validating
   the certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server
   mutual-authentication setup. (CVE-2019-19269)
 * In ProFTPD 1.3.7, it is possible to corrupt the memory pool by interrupting
   the data transfer channel. This triggers a use-after-free in alloc_pool in
   pool.c, and possible remote code execution. (CVE-2020-9273)
