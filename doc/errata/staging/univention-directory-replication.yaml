desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The `slapo-lastbind` LDAP overlay can now be activated via the UCR variable
   `ldap/overlay/lastbind` which when activated stores the timestamp of an
   successful bind to an LDAP server. The script
   `/usr/share/univention-ldap/univention_lastbind.py` can be used to store
   the youngest of these timestamps, from all reachable LDAP servers, into the
   `lastbind` extended attribute of a specified user.
