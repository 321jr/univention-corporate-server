 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The 'slapo-lastbind' LDAP overlay can now be activated via the
   'ldap/overlay/lastbind' UCR variable which when activated stores the
   timestamp of an successful bind to an LDAP server. The 
   '/usr/share/univention-ldap/univention_lastbind.py' script can be used to
   store the youngest of these timestamps, from all reachable LDAP servers,
   into the 'lastbind' extended attribute of an specified user.
