desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Internal change: the UCR templates of are now python3-compatible.
 * Do incremental updates for attribute `uniqueMember` of groups: Changes
   trigger the slapd overlay module `memberof`, which then needs to update all
   users of the group. This is inefficient with MOD_REPLACE as the overlay
   then has to walk over all users instead of only the added/removed users.
   During the walk each user object is touched and triggers a sub-transaction
   in OpenDLAP. With slow disks this even can lead to TIMEOUT errors as the
   LDAP connection is closed after 5 minutes by default.
