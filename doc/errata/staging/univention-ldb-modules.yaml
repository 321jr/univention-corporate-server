desc: |
 The package has been rebuilt against the most recent ldb version.
 Additionally a change from ucs-school-4.1 package version 4.0.0-2 has been
 backported, which relaxes the strict version chang on the exact ldb library
 version. This is just a pre-caution against issues related to package update
 oder on UCS@school Slave "PDCs" running Samba AD.
