desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An issue was discovered in PHPMailer before 5.2.22. PHPMailer's msgHTML
   method applies transformations to an HTML document to make it usable as an
   email message body. One of the transformations is to convert relative image
   URLs into attachments using a script-provided base directory. If no base
   directory is provided, it resolves to /, meaning that relative image URLs
   get treated as absolute local file paths and added as attachments. To form
   a remote vulnerability, the msgHTML method must be called, passed an
   unfiltered, user-supplied HTML document, and must not set a base directory.
   (CVE-2017-5223)
 * PHPMailer before 5.2.27 and 6.x before 6.0.6 is vulnerable to an object
   injection attack. (CVE-2018-19296)
