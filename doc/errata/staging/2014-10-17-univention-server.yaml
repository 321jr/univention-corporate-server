desc: |
  * Added a new cron job on domaincontroller master systems that calls the
    new script lock_expired_accounts on a regular basis to automatically
    disable POSIX logins if the affected user account reached the
    expiration date. It may be disabled via UCR:
    ucr set directory/manager/user/lock_expired_accounts/cron/enabled=no
  * A second cron job that calls the new script lock_expired_passwords
    on a regular basis to automatically disable POSIX logins if the
    password of the affected user account has reached the password
    expiration date. To prevent a change in behaviour, this cron job is
    disabled by default and may be activated via UCR:
    ucr set directory/manager/user/lock_expired_passwords/cron/enabled=yes
