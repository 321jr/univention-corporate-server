 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The locale is not replaced by the Country syntax class anymore. This caused
   side effects in all processes which imported the UDM python modules. For
   example the translation of the appcenter UMC modules was not possible
   (Bug 39146).
 * Domain names for mail domains are now lowercased (Bug 39721).
