desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The listfilter policy service can now write debugging information to the
   mail log, when the UCR variable mail/postfix/policy/listfilter/debug is
   set to "yes" (Bug #44922).
 * The content of the files main.cf.local and master.cf.local will now be
   appended to /etc/postfix/main.cf and /etc/postfix/master.cf respectively.
   After editing the *.local files, ucr commit /etc/postfix/*.cf must be
   called (Bug # 44473).
 * When upgrading from a system that previously used Cyrus, the now
   deprecated mail quota policies can be removed using the script
   /usr/share/univention-mail-postfix/remove_mail_quota_policy (Bug #46454).
