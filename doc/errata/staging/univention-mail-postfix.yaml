desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Support for forwarding emails to external addresses has been added
   (Bug #42249).
 * The default of the UCR variable mail/postfix/tls/client/level when
   unset has been changed to "may". On existing UCS installations this
   has already been set explicitely (Bug #44589).
 * When a relay host with authentication is used (mail/relayauth=yes),
   the Postfix option smtp_tls_security_level will automatically be set
   to "encrypt", unless mail/postfix/tls/client/level is set to "none"
   (Bug #44589).
bug: [42249, 44589]
