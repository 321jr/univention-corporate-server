  This update addresses the following issues:
  * Errors when checking restrictions of mailing lists and mail groups are
    now written to the system mail log (Bug 40376).
  * The user that wants to send to a restricted mailinglist or group mail is
    now determined using the SASL login. This requires, that the sender logs
    into the server to deliver the email. To enable the previous behavior
    (to use the email address declared by the sender), set the UCR variable
    'mail/postfix/policy/listfilter/use_sasl_username' to "no" (Bug 29615).
