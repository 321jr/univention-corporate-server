  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Add libvirt-check.sh to virtualization nodes. It periodically tests if
    libvirtd responds and restarts libvirtd if necessary.
  * Change libvirt-bin initscript to use sv force-stop and sv force-restart.
  * The documentation for configuring bridges has been moved from the extended
    documentation into the main manual. The links were updated accordingly.
  * Added libvirtd logging functionality with new UCR variables:
    libvirt/log/level, libvirt/log/filters, libvirt/log/outputs
