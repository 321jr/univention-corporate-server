desc: |
 This update fixes two virtualization problems:
 * an overflow in the KVM time handling code prevented the start of a VM.
 * in some situations the Xen netback driver caused an OOPS and prevented any
   VM from accessing the network.
note: This is the second part of the fix, which updates the meta package.
