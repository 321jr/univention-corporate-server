 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Xen, when used on a system providing PV backends, allows local guest OS
   administrators to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain
   privileges by writing to memory shared between the frontend and backend,
   aka a double fetch vulnerability (CVE-2015-8550)
 * The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using
   Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest
   administrators to hit BUG conditions and cause a denial of service (NULL
   pointer dereference and host OS crash) by leveraging a system with access
   to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device and a crafted
   sequence of XEN_PCI_OP_* operations, aka "Linux pciback missing sanity
   checks." (CVE-2015-8551)
 * The tty_set_termios_ldisc function in drivers/tty/tty_ldisc.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.5 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
   kernel memory by reading a tty data structure (CVE-2015-8964)
 * crypto/algif_skcipher.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.2 does not verify
   that a setkey operation has been performed on an AF_ALG socket before an
   accept system call is processed, which allows local users to cause a denial
   of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted
   application that does not supply a key, related to the lrw_crypt function
   in crypto/lrw.c (CVE-2015-8970)
 * Xen and the Linux kernel through 4.5.x do not properly suppress hugetlbfs
   support in x86 PV guests, which allows local PV guest OS users to cause a
   denial of service (guest OS crash) by attempting to access a hugetlbfs
   mapped area (CVE-2016-3961)
 * The tcp_check_send_head function in include/net/tcp.h in the Linux kernel
   before 4.7.5 does not properly maintain certain SACK state after a failed
   data copy, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
   (tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue use-after-free and system crash) via a crafted
   SACK option (CVE-2016-6828)
 * The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel
   through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is
   enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption
   and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file (CVE-2016-7042)
 * The arcmsr_iop_message_xfer function in drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_hba.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 does not restrict a certain length field,
   which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
   (heap-based buffer overflow) via an ARCMSR_MESSAGE_WRITE_WQBUFFER control
   code (CVE-2016-7425)
 * drivers/firewire/net.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, in certain unusual
   hardware configurations, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
   via crafted fragmented packets (CVE-2016-8633)
 * The TCP stack in the Linux kernel before 4.8.10 mishandles skb truncation,
   which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a
   crafted application that makes sendto system calls, related to
   net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c and net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c (CVE-2016-8645)
 * The mpi_powm function in lib/mpi/mpi-pow.c in the Linux kernel through
   4.8.11 does not ensure that memory is allocated for limb data, which allows
   local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and
   panic) via an add_key system call for an RSA key with a zero exponent
   (CVE-2016-8650)
 * Stack-based buffer overflow in the brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap function in
   drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.7.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system
   crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long SSID
   Information Element in a command to a Netlink socket (CVE-2016-8658)
 * The sctp_sf_ootb function in net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c in the Linux kernel
   before 4.8.8 lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds slab access)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP data
   (CVE-2016-9555)
 * Race condition in the snd_pcm_period_elapsed function in
   sound/core/pcm_lib.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.7
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_START command (CVE-2016-9794)
