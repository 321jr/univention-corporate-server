 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2015-7515: The aiptek_probe function in
   drivers/input/tablet/aiptek.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows
   physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
   dereference and system crash) via a crafted USB device that lacks
   endpoints.
 * CVE-2016-0821: The LIST_POISON feature in
   include/linux/poison.h in the Linux kernel before 4.3, as used in Android
   6.0.1 before 2016-03-01, does not properly consider the relationship to the
   mmap_min_addr value, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass a
   poison-pointer protection mechanism by triggering the use of an
   uninitialized list entry, aka Android internal bug 26186802, a different
   vulnerability than CVE-2015-3636
 * CVE-2016-1237: nfsd in the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 allows local users to
   bypass intended file-permission restrictions by setting a POSIX ACL,
   related to nfs2acl.c, nfs3acl.c, and nfs4acl.c.
 * CVE-2016-1583: The ecryptfs_privileged_open function in
   fs/ecryptfs/kthread.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.3 allows local users
   to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (stack memory consumption)
   via vectors involving crafted mmap calls for /proc pathnames, leading to
   recursive pagefault handling.

   s390 platforms mishandles the case of four page-table levels, which allows
   local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via a crafted application, related to

   in the snd-usb-audio driver in the Linux kernel before 4.5.1 allows
   physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
   dereference or double free, and system crash) via a crafted endpoints value
   in a USB device descriptor.

   descriptor.
 * CVE-2016-2187: The gtco_probe function in drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 allows physically proximate attackers to

   crafted endpoints value in a USB device descriptor.
 * CVE-2016-3070: Null pointer dereference in trace_writeback_dirty_page()
 * CVE-2016-3134: The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2
   does not validate certain offset fields, which allows local users to gain
   privileges or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via an
   IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE setsockopt call.
 * CVE-2016-3136: The mct_u232_msr_to_state function in
   drivers/usb/serial/mct_u232.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5.1 allows
   physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
   dereference and system crash) via a crafted USB device without two
   interrupt-in endpoint descriptors.

   USB device descriptor.
 * CVE-2016-3156: The IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.5.2

   leveraging I/O port access.
 * CVE-2016-3672: The arch_pick_mmap_layout function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 does not properly randomize the legacy base

   mechanism for a setuid or setgid program, by disabling stack-consumption
   resource limits.
 * CVE-2016-3951: Double free vulnerability in drivers/net/usb/cdc_ncm.c in

   suppress hugetlbfs support in x86 PV guests, which allows local PV guest OS
   users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) by attempting to access
   a hugetlbfs mapped area.
 * CVE-2016-4470: The key_reject_and_link function in security/keys/key.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.6.3 does not ensure that a certain data
   structure is initialized, which allows local users to cause a denial of
   service (system crash) via vectors involving a crafted keyctl request2
   command.
 * CVE-2016-4482: The proc_connectinfo function in drivers/usb/core/devio.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.6 does not initialize a certain data structure,
   which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack
   memory via a crafted USBDEVFS_CONNECTINFO ioctl call.
 * CVE-2016-4485: The llc_cmsg_rcv function in net/llc/af_llc.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.5.5 does not initialize a certain data structure, which
   allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory
   by reading a message.
 * CVE-2016-4486: The rtnl_fill_link_ifmap function in net/core/rtnetlink.c in

   initialize certain r1 data structures, which allows local users to obtain
   sensitive information from kernel stack memory via crafted use of the ALSA
   timer interface, related to the (1) snd_timer_user_ccallback and (2)
   snd_timer_user_tinterrupt functions.
 * CVE-2016-4580: The x25_negotiate_facilities function in
