 This updates the Linux kernel to version 4.9.228, which addresses (among
 others) the following security issues:
 * l2tp: Race condition between pppol2tp_session_create() and
   l2tp_eth_create() (CVE-2018-9517)
 * go7007_snd_init in drivers/media/usb/go7007/snd-go7007.c in the Linux
   kernel before 5.6 does not call snd_card_free for a failure path, which
   causes a memory leak (CVE-2019-20810)
 * In calc_vm_may_flags of ashmem.c, there is a possible arbitrary write to
   shared memory due to a permissions bypass. This could lead to local
   escalation of privilege by corrupting memory shared between processes, with
   no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
   for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android kernel Android ID:
   A-142938932 (CVE-2020-0009)
 * some ipv6 protocols not encrypted over ipsec tunnel. (CVE-2020-1749)
 * use-after-free in cdev_put() when a PTP device is removed while it's
   chardev is open (CVE-2020-10690)
 * Rogue cross-process SSBD shutdown. Linux scheduler logical bug allows an
   attacker to turn off the SSBD protection. (CVE-2020-10766)
 * Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier is force-disabled when STIBP is
   unavailable or enhanced IBRS is available. (CVE-2020-10767)
 * Indirect branch speculation can be enabled after it was force-disabled by
   the PR_SPEC_FORCE_DISABLE prctl command. (CVE-2020-10768)
 * DoS via concurrent calls to dw_spi_irq and dw_spi_transfer_one functions in
   drivers/spi/spi-dw.c (CVE-2020-12769)
 * possible to send arbitrary signals to a privileged (suidroot) parent
   process (CVE-2020-12826)
 * ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.7.1.
   drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called
   several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the
   community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue
   in this case. (CVE-2020-13974)
note: This is the 3rd of three related updates.
