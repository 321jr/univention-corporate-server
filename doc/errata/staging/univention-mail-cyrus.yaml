desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * After an upgrade from UCS 4.1 to UCS 4.2 the Cyrus daemons did not
   start automatically anymore. When installing this bugfix the service
   will be enabled automatically in systemd (Bug #44377).
 * The paths to Cyrus executables have been adjusted for Debian Jessie
   (Bug #44424).
 * The path to the tool to automatically purge old entries from the Cyrus
   "duplicate delivery database" has been fixed. As the path was wrong in
   the past, the tool never ran. When starting it (the first time), it may
   take minutes or hours (depending on the database size). Thus for this
   update the tool has been disabled by default, but it will be enabled
   by default when updating to UCS 4.2-1. Via the new UCR variables
   mail/cyrus/duplicate-supression/expiry/start and
   mail/cyrus/duplicate-supression/expiry/event this cleanup job can be
   configured to be run when starting Cyrus or regularly at 4:01 each
   night (Bug #22852).
