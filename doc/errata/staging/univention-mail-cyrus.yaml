desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * After an upgrade from UCS 4.1 to UCS 4.2 the Cyrus daemons did not
   start automatically anymore. When installing this bugfix the service
   will be enabled automatically (Bug #44377).
 * The paths to executables have been adjusted for Debian Jessie
   (Bug #44424).
 * Before UCS 4.2 the Cyrus tool ctl_deliver has been called to remove
   expired entries within the deliver.db. Due to a wrong search path, the
   tool never came into effect. Please note: by fixing bug #44424 and
   bug #22852, the command is now executed for the first time, which may
   cause a delayed startup of the Cyrus daemons. Depending on the size
   of the current deliver.db, this may take minutes or hours.
   Additionally cyr_expire is now called directly instead of the wrapper
   ctl_deliver (Bug #22852).
