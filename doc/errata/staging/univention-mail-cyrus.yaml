desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * After an upgrade from UCS 4.1 to UCS 4.2 the Cyrus daemons did not
   start automatically anymore. When installing this bugfix the service
   will be enabled automatically in systemd (Bug #44377).
 * The paths to Cyrus executables have been adjusted for Debian Jessie
   (Bug #44424).
 * The path to the tool to automatically purge old entries from the Cyrus
   "duplicate delivery database" has been fixed. As it was wrong the tool
   never ran. When starting it the first time, it may take minutes or
   hours. Thus for this update it has been disabled by default, but it
   will be enabled by default when updating to UCS 4.2-1. The UCR variables
   mail/cyrus/duplicate-supression/expiry/start and
   mail/cyrus/duplicate-supression/expiry/event enable or disable running
   this cleanup job when starting Cyrus or at 4:01 at night (Bug #22852).
