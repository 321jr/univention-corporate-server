desc: |
 This erratum update fixes the following issues:
 * The univention-virtual-machine-manager-daemon now uses the internal libvirt
   event-loop implementation. This fixes a problem with accumulating open file
   handles, which lead to performance problems in large environments.
 * The title of noVNC tabs/windows now includes the name of the virtual machine
   and the name of the host.
