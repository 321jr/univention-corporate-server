  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Renamed the App ID for "Tine 2.0" from tine20org to tine20 to reflect that
    this is the commercial version.
  * Components in the App Center's tab "Repository Settings" may have default
    packages which can be installed via the grid. Before this is done, the App
    Center now updates the package list.
