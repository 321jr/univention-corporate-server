version: [1]
desc: |
  * The users/user udm module and the license check have been extended
    to ignore certain LDAP objects with the attribute
    univentionObjectFlag:functional
  * Python UDM extensions are now installed with update-python-support
  * The "default" attribute of an UDM object's property is now configurable via
    UCR (e.g. by setting
    directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/properties/mailHomeServer/default).
  * A problem which occured when trying to assign DNS or DHCP zones to
    computer objects without IP address have been fixed
  * The dependecy list of the package has been updated. Prior to this change,
    slapd was left installed on a memberserver when using the appliance mode
    which could lead to problems when this system was querying LDAP.
