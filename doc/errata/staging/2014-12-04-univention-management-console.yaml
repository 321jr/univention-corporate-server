 This update addresses the following issues:
  * Allows UMC modules to set the response status when the module
    initialization fails. This is required to show the login dialog after a
    password change.
  * UMC identifies now also users without posix account as LDAP users.
  * Fixed a bug which prevented that UMC components could write into their
    logfiles.
