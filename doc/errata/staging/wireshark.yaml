 * In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12, the UMTS MAC dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-umts_mac.c by rejecting a certain reserved value. (CVE-2018-7334)
 * In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.4 and 2.2.0 to 2.2.12, the IEEE 802.11 dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/crypt/airpdcap.c by rejecting lengths that are too small. (CVE-2018-7335)

 * In Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the Q.931 dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-q931.c by avoiding a use-after-free after a malformed packet prevented certain cleanup. (CVE-2018-11358)
 CVE_2018-11359 is open
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0, 2.4.0 to 2.4.6, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.14, the LDSS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ldss.c by avoiding a buffer over-read upon encountering a missing '\0' character. (CVE-2018-11362)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the MMSE dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/proto.c by adding offset and length validation. (CVE-2018-14339)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, dissectors that support zlib decompression could crash. This was addressed in epan/tvbuff_zlib.c by rejecting negative lengths to avoid a buffer over-read. (CVE-2018-14340)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the DICOM dissector could go into a large or infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcm.c by preventing an offset overflow. (CVE-2018-14341)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the BGP protocol dissector could go into a large loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bgp.c by validating Path Attribute lengths. (CVE-2018-14342)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the ASN.1 BER dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c by ensuring that length values do not exceed the maximum signed integer. (CVE-2018-14343)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the Bazaar protocol dissector could go into an infinite loop. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bzr.c by properly handling items that are too long. (CVE-2018-14368)
 * In Wireshark 2.6.0 to 2.6.1, 2.4.0 to 2.4.7, and 2.2.0 to 2.2.15, the HTTP2 dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-http2.c by verifying that header data was found before proceeding to header decompression. (CVE-2018-14369)
