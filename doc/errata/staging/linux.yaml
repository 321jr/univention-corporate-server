fix: 4.1.6-1.227.201706090945
desc: |-
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The keyring_search_aux function in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux
   kernel through 3.14.79 allows local users to cause a denial of service
   (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a request_key system call for the
   "dead" type (CVE-2017-6951)
 * The sg_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in the Linux kernel through
   4.10.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer
   overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large command
   size in an SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN ioctl call, leading to out-of-bounds write
   access in the sg_write function (CVE-2017-7187)
 * The vmw_surface_define_ioctl function in
   drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.5
   does not check for a zero value of certain levels data, which allows local
   users to cause a denial of service (ZERO_SIZE_PTR dereference, and GPF and
   possibly panic) via a crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device
   (CVE-2017-7261)
 * The vmw_surface_define_ioctl function in
   drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6
   does not validate addition of certain levels data, which allows local users
   to trigger an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write, and cause a denial
   of service (system hang or crash) or possibly gain privileges, via a
   crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device (CVE-2017-7294)
 * The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.10.13 allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of
   KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring calls
   (CVE-2017-7472)
 * crypto/ahash.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.9 allows attackers to cause
   a denial of service (API operation calling its own callback, and infinite
   recursion) by triggering EBUSY on a full queue (CVE-2017-7618)
 * The NFSv2/NFSv3 server in the nfsd subsystem in the Linux kernel through
   4.10.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash)
   via a long RPC reply, related to net/sunrpc/svc.c, fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c, and
   fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c (CVE-2017-7645)
 * udp.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5 allows remote attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via UDP traffic that triggers an unsafe second checksum
   calculation during execution of a recv system call with the MSG_PEEK flag
   (CVE-2016-10229)
 * The iowarrior_probe function in drivers/usb/misc/iowarrior.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.5.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial
   of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted
   endpoints value in a USB device descriptor (CVE-2016-2188)
 * An information disclosure vulnerability in kernel components including the
   ION subsystem, Binder, USB driver and networking subsystem could enable a
   local malicious application to access data outside of its permission
   levels. This issue is rated as Moderate because it first requires
   compromising a privileged process (CVE-2016-8405)
 * The cgroup offline implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11
   mishandles certain drain operations, which allows local users to cause a
   denial of service (system hang) by leveraging access to a container
   environment for executing a crafted application, as demonstrated by trinity
   (CVE-2016-9191)
 * The built-in keyrings for security tokens can be joined as a session and
   then modified by the root user (CVE-2016-9604)
 * The klsi_105_get_line_state function in drivers/usb/serial/kl5kusb105.c in
   the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 places uninitialized heap-memory contents
   into a log entry upon a failure to read the line status, which allows local
   users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log (CVE-2017-5549)
 * The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does
   not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which
   allows local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection
   mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget
   and shmat system calls in a privileged context (CVE-2017-5669)
 * The cp_report_fixup function in drivers/hid/hid-cypress.c in the Linux
   kernel 4.x before 4.9.4 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a
   denial of service (integer underflow) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted HID report (CVE-2017-7273)
 * The edge_bulk_in_callback function in drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c in the
   Linux kernel before 4.10.4 allows local users to obtain sensitive
   information (in the dmesg ringbuffer and syslog) from uninitialized kernel
   memory by using a crafted USB device (posing as an io_ti USB serial device)
   to trigger an integer underflow (CVE-2017-8924)
 * The omninet_open function in drivers/usb/serial/omninet.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.10.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (tty
   exhaustion) by leveraging reference count mishandling (CVE-2017-8925)
