 The permissions for the directory "/etc/univention/ssl" and the files contained in it
 where mangled on certificate renewal via the UMC "System Setup" module.
 New certificates created using "univention-certificate new" were created with incorrect
 permissions.
 This update fixes these issues, making sure that the group "DC Backup Hosts" has access
 to the certificates.
