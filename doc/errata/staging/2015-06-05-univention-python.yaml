  This update addresses the following issue:
   * Evaluation of the new "ldapFilter" attribute has been added to
     the library functions.
   * The Python implementation of univention-policy-result did not evaluate
     the attributes "requiredObjectClass" and "prohibitedObjectClasses". This
     has been fixed.
   * The Python implementation of univention-policy-result did not return the
     most specific policy in all cases. This has been fixed.
