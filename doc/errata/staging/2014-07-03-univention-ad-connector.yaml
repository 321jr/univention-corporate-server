  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Support for the ad/member mode has been added.
  * In some cases a removed group membership was not synchronized
    from OpenLDAP to Active Directory in write mode.
  * The AD certificate chain is no longer checked if there is no 
    root certificate configured.
  * Kerberos support has been added to the UCS AD connector.
  * A script has been added for renaming groups and users with Well Known SIDs
    to the corresponding name in the AD domain. This script is for internal use
    by the setup wizard for the UCS in AD member mode.
