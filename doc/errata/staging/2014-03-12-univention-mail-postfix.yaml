fix: 8.0.11-1.211.201403131645
note:
version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The postfix policy service listfilter (to restrict email delivery to
    groups and lists) is now executed as user listfilter instead of the user
    cyrus to allow this feature also in environments without the 
    component univention-mail-cyrus.
  * The new UCR variable mail/postfix/ldaptable/starttls has been introduced to
    define whether postfix should use an encrypted (TLS) connection for ldap
    lookups (default: yes).
