note:
version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The postfix policy service listfilter (to restrict email delivery to
	groups and lists) is now executed as user listfilter instead of the user
    cyrus to allow this feature also in environments without the 
    component univention-mail-cyrus.
