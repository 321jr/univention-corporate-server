  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * In some cases, an unsuccessful app installation
    was still acknowledged as successful. This fix
    ensures that the appcenter receives a correct 
    status code for those cases.
  * During app installation there was a mix of popup dialogs and dedicated
    pages. These have been unified into an installation wizard.
