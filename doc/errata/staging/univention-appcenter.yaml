 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Improved the image gallery in the details page of an app. The handling
   of YouTube videos has been improved and enlarging thumbnails is smoother. 
 * A helptext still mentioned the Free-for-personal-Use Edition. This has been
   replaced with the UCS Core Edition.
 * The overview of software changes has been enhanced.
 * A margin has been added to the footer buttons of the installation error page.
 * Join scripts and unjoin scripts are now correctly removed while installing
   and uninstalling an App.
 * Minor code changes make other projects easier that rely on the App Center.
 * univention-app shell now correctly exits with the exit code of the called
   command.
 * univention-app installed unsigned packages.
 * The "Package Management" module can be opened via hash again.
 * Details of software packages can be shown again.
 * The installation status of Docker Apps was determined incorrectly by certain
   functions of the App Center. This has been fixed.
 * Joinscripts of Docker Apps are run via univention-run-join-scripts instead
   of being called directly.
