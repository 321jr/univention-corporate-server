desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Checking whether docker is up and running at the startup of the App Center
   can now be disabled by setting the UCR variable appcenter/docker=diabled. In
   this case, Docker Apps cannot be installed anymore.
 * Added a new command for univention-app: univention-app shell runs a command
   within the environment of a Docker App.
 * Warnings shown before App installation (like very few available RAM) do not
   show up as errors after a successful installation anymore.
 * Docker Containers are now correctly cleaned up if the installation fails.
 * Downloading specific files from the App Center server now makes use of
   ETags, resulting in a speedup of module opening.
