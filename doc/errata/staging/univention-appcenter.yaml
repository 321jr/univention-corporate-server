desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * It is now checked if the schema exists before writing ACL definitions to
   slapd.conf. This prevents some false positive error messages during join.
 * The App Center sometimes installed the last-to-latest App version.
 * Executing missing join scripts in a Docker Container is now supported.
