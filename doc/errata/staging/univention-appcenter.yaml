fix: 8.0.11-110A~4.4.0.202002241225
desc: |-
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In some cases, an unsuccessful app installation was still acknowledged
   as successful. This fix ensures that the appcenter receives a correct 
   status code for those cases.
 * During app installation there was a mix of popup dialogs and dedicated
   pages. These have been unified into an installation wizard.
 * Errors in a cached response in the UMC module could lead to tracebacks. 
   This has been fixed.
 * The warning message indicating a potentially long installation time of
   container based apps has been removed.
 * The error tracking for failed docker pull requests has been improved.
