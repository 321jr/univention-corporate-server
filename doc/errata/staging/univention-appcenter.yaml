fix: 7.0.2-28A~4.3.0.201809111522
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When an app is opened in the App Center,
   the page now scrolls to the beginning
   and when the App detail page is closed,
   the previous scroll position is restored.
 * A purge command for univention-app has been introduced
 * Proxy settings in containers are updated before an
   app upgrade.
 * Installation routines now ask for valid credentials before actually doing
   anything. This prevents possible errors when reverting the installation
   status should the credentials be invalid.
