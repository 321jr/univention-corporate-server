release: "4.1"
version: [4]
scope: ucs_4.1-0-errata4.1-4
src: univention-appcenter
fix: 5.0.23-54.281.201702151759
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The App Center no longer uses '-e var=value' for environment variables when
   starting container. Instead an env file is created.
 * Temporary files in Docker containers are created from outside. Creating
   them inside turned out to be unreliable.
 * UDP Ports are now configured with a different attribute to be backward
   compatible with older App Center versions.
 * An error during the installation of apps has been fixed which was caused by
   code changes in erratum 395.
