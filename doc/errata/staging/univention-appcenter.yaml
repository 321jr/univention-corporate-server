  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * Improved the label in the App Center gallery: It is now more clear that
    Apps may be installed on other servers than the local host.
  * The handling of cache files is now more careful, leading to less error
    messages.
  * When connecting to the MySQL server fails during the installation of Apps
    with Database integration, a helpful error message is shown instead of a
    traceback.
