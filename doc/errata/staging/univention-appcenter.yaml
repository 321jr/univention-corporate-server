version: [4]

fix: 5.0.23-52.279.201702150242
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The App Center no longer uses '-e var=value' for environment variables when
   starting container. Instead an env file is created.
 * Temporary files in Docker containers are created from outside. Creating
   them inside turned out to be unreliable.
 * UDP Ports are now configured with a different attribute to be backward
   compatible with older App Center versions.
