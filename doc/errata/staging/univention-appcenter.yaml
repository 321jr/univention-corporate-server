  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The layout of the App Center gallery has been improved.
  * On an app details page, it is now possible to navigate to the previous and
    next app in the search results.
  * The app details page for small domains has been simplified.
  * Apps now support RequiredAppsInDomain which can be used to state that a
    specific App has to be installed somewhere in the domain in order for the
    current App to work.
  * Performance optimizations: Caching all apps in one Python pickle file for
    faster rereading.
  * Performance optimizations: Vastly decreasing the cost of using Univention
    Config Registry in the App Center module by using a singleton object.
  * Fixing developer scripts for using a local App Center.
  * One function of the Docker Apps Joinscript helpers has been fixed when
    called from within the UMC module.
  * Uninstalling the last app doesn't cause a "Forbidden" pop up anymore.
  * Calling univention-app does not log the complete set of options, instead
    just the name of the action being called.
  * univention-app upgrade now correctly upgrades all packages for non Docker
    Apps.
