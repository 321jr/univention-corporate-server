fix: 5.0.21-19.190.201607141025
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Access to the object class "univentionApp" is now more restrictive.
 * The AppCenter now displays a warning if a conflict between the systems
   network settings and the docker bridge network has been detected.
 * When searching for Apps, the Vendor (and Maintainer) of the App is
   considered.
 * Apps may now require a specific version to be already installed, before an
   upgrade is possible.
 * When opening an App in the Gallery that is not yet installed, a
   notification is sent to Univention.
 * When (un)installing an App, a notification is always sent to Univention. If
   the App does not say otherwise, this notification is anonymized.
 * Minor code changes make other projects easier that rely on the App Center.
