 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * ISVs can now define colors and modules for their appliances.
 * Apps may define ports they want to occupy exclusively. Docker Apps checked
   before installation whether an already installed App excepts exclusive
   access to one of these ports. This check has been extended to Non-Docker
   Apps.
