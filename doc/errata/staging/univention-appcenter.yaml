fix: 5.0.22-21.227.201610181743
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Fixed handling of App Settings for Docker Apps that do not use a UCS based
   container.
 * If a Docker version of an App is released, but a Non-Docker version is
   installed, this version is not shown (and not installable) by default. If
   the App Center is used from a different system, an update is shown, though.
   This display issue was fixed.
 * The initialization of all Apps could result in a traceback for Apps with a
   certain version history.
