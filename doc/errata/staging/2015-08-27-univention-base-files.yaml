  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The list of supported message digest, encryption and key exchange
    algorithms allowed by the SSH daemon can now be configured through the
    new UCR variables 'sshd/MACs', 'sshd/Ciphers', and 'sshd/KexAlgorithms'.
    * The un-secure SSH protocols 'rsa1' and 'dsa' have been disabled. They can
    be re-enabled through the new UCR variables 'sshd/Protocol' and
    'sshd/HostKey'.
