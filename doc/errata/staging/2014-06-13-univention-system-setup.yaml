fix: 7.0.69-10.571.201407091358
version: [2]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The univention-system-setup module process will not read the setup script
    output from pipe anymore. Instead, the output is directly written to the log.
    This way, running setup scripts will not terminate when the UMC module process
    does.
  * Request successfull request processing will not be reported before the actual
    request processing anymore.
  * Added welcome page with instructions to set a root password
    before accessing the setup wizard
  * Welcome page is now the apache default site when installing
    univention-system-setup-boot
