  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The setup wizard for UCS appliance has been entirely re-structured and
    rewritten, obsolete code paths have been cleaned up.
    Some of the new features inlcude:
    - A live search for world-wide cities to preconfigure locale settings.
    - Wizard language can be changed on the fly without a page load.
    - Some fields (host + domain name, gateway address etc.) are pre-filled
      with suggested values to ease the configuration.
    - The UCS license activation can now be carried within the wizard.
    - UCS components from the App Center can be installed in the wizard.
  * The univention-system-setup module process will not read the setup script
    output from pipe anymore. Instead, the output is directly written to the log.
    This way, running setup scripts will not terminate when the UMC module process
    does.
  * Successful request processing will no longer be reported before the actual
    request processing is done.
  * Added welcome page with instructions to set a root password
    before accessing the setup wizard for EC2 setups
  * Welcome page is now the apache default site when installing
    univention-system-setup-boot
