fix: 14.4.1-5+deb9u2
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Divide by zero in startread function in wav.c (CVE-2017-11332)
 * Invalid memory read in read_samples function in hcom.c (CVE-2017-11358)
 * Devide by zero in wavwritehdr function in wav.c (CVE-2017-11359)
 * There is a heap-based buffer overflow in the ImaExpandS function of
   ima_rw.c in Sound eXchange (SoX) 14.4.2. A Crafted input will lead to a
   denial of service attack during conversion of an audio file.
   (CVE-2017-15370)
 * Reachable assertion abort in the function sox_append_comment()
   (CVE-2017-15371)
 * There is a stack-based buffer overflow in the lsx_ms_adpcm_block_expand_i
   function of adpcm.c in Sound eXchange (SoX) 14.4.2. A Crafted input will
   lead to a denial of service attack during conversion of an audio file.
   (CVE-2017-15372)
 * In lsx_aiffstartread in aiff.c in Sound eXchange (SoX) 14.4.2, there is a
   Use-After-Free vulnerability triggered by supplying a malformed AIFF file.
   (CVE-2017-15642)
 * In the startread function in xa.c in Sound eXchange (SoX) through 14.4.2, a
   corrupt header specifying zero channels triggers an infinite loop with a
   resultant NULL pointer dereference, which may allow a remote attacker to
   cause a denial-of-service. (CVE-2017-18189)
 * integer overflow in function lsx_make_lpf in effect_i_dsp.c (CVE-2019-8354)
 * integer overflow in xmalloc.h (CVE-2019-8355)
 * stack-based buffer overflow in bitrv2 in fft4g.c (CVE-2019-8356)
 * null pointer dereference in function lsx_make_lpf in effect_i_dsp.c
   (CVE-2019-8357)
 * SoX - Sound eXchange 14.4.2 and earlier is affected by: Out-of-bounds Read.
   The impact is: Denial of Service. The component is: read_samples function
   at xa.c:219. The attack vector is: Victim must open specially crafted .xa
   file. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2017-18189. (CVE-2019-1010004)
