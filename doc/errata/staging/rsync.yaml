product: ucs
release: "4.2"
version: [3]
scope: ucs_4.2-0-errata4.2-3
src: rsync
fix: 3.1.1-3+deb8u1A~4.2.3.201801251012
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The receive_xattr function in xattrs.c does not check for a trailing '\0'
   character in an xattr name, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) or possibly
   have unspecified other impact by sending crafted data to the daemon.
   (CVE-2017-16548)
 * The recv_files function in receiver.c proceeds with certain file metadata
   updates before checking for a filename in the daemon_filter_list data
   structure, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
   restrictions. (CVE-2017-17433)
 * rsync does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data
   structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not
   apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in "xname
   follows" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which
   allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
