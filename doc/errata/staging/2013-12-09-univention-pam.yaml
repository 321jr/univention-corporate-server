  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * univention-pam now checks mapping of group names 
    in the config registry templates.
  * The listener module group-name-mapping.py has been added to 
    automatically set group name mapping UCR variables 
    (groups/default/.*) if well known groups are renamed.
  * The default limit for "max open files" (nofile) in 
    /etc/security/limits.conf has been increased to "8192".
    This value can be changed by setting the ucr variables
    "security/limits/user/default/soft/nofile" and
    "security/limits/user/default/hard/nofile".
