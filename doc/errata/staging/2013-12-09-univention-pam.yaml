  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * The new listener module well-known-sid-name-mapping.py implements
    a mechanism for domain wide customization of account names for
    well known Windows/Samba SIDs. It sets UCR variables "groups/default/.*"
    and "users/default/.*" in case accounts with well known sids are renamed.
  * univention-pam now checks the mapping of user and group names 
    in the config registry templates.
  * The default limit for "max open files" (nofile) in 
    /etc/security/limits.conf has been increased to "8192".
    This value can be changed by setting the ucr variables
    "security/limits/default/user/soft/nofile" and
    "security/limits/default/user/hard/nofile".
