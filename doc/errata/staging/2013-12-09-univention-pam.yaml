  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * univention-pam now checks mapping of group names (localization) 
    in the config registry templates.
  * The listener module group-name-mapping.py has been added to 
    automatically set group name localization UCR variables 
    (groups/default/.*) if well known groups are renamed.
