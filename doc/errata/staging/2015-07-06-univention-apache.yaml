fix: 6.0.16-11.240.201507131307
version: [6]
desc: |
 The configuration of the SSL/TLS support in Apache has been improved:
 - Apache no longer accepts various insecure ciphers and hash algorithms
   (e.g. RC4, MD5 and the outdated "export ciphers") by default. Note
   that such algorithms would not have been negotiated if the TLS
   client supports current crypto algorithms. A different set of ciphers
   can be configured using the new UCR variable 'apache2/ssl/ciphersuite'.
 - If the new UCR variable 'apache2/ssl/honorcipherorder' is set, the
   server choice of ciphers is used instead of the ciphers preferred by
   the TLS client.
 Please refer to the UCR variable descriptions for additional details.
