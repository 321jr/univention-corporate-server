  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * adjust the behaviour of ucs_registerLDAPExtension, to let
    join scripts continue in case an LDAP extension could not
    be registered because a newer one is already active in the
    domain.
  * Group name mapping has been added to univention-lib. 
    The new function "custom_groupname" maps the default group names
    to the actual name.
  * User name mapping has been added to univention-lib. 
    The new function "custom_username" maps the default user names
    to the actual name.
  * A new pyhton lib "s4" has been added for samba4 related stuff.
