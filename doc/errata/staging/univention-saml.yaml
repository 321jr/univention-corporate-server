 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The configuration of SAML identity providers has been extended
   by the possibility to configure an attribute mapping
   for the LDAPattributes required by the Service providers.
 * The self service can now be set up to allow users to create their
   own account (see also Bug #51067). For this new feature the SAML identity
   provider has been adapted, to be configurable to deny login for
   unverified, self registered accounts.
