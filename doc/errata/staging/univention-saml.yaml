 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The configuration of SAML identity providers has been extended
   by the possibility to configure an attribute mapping
   for the LDAPattributes required by the Service providers.
 * The self service can now be set up to allow users to create their
   own account (see also bug 51067). For this new feature the SAML identity
   provider has been adapted, to be configurable to deny login for
   unverified, self registered accounts.
