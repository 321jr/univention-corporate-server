 This errata fixes two issues in the samba package:
 * Adjustments to GPO security filters (aka delegation) made by the Group Policy
   Management Console (GPMC) could get lost in the sysvol filesystem (replaced
   by older settings) during the sysvol synchronization. In this case starting
   GPMC issued a warning message and GPO evaluation could lead to unexpected
   results on Windows clients. This errata update causes Samba to update
   modification timestamps of GPO files in the sysvol share whenever ACLs are
   changed by the GPMC for security filtering. The new modification timestamps
   prevent the changed file ACLs to be overwritten during the rsync of sysvol.
   Basically this is a workaround for a behaviour specific to rsync.
 * Versions in the package dependencies have been updated.
