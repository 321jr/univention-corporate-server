 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * 
 CVE_2012-0880 is open
 * In Apache Xerces-C XML Parser library before 3.2.1, processing of external DTD paths can result in a null pointer dereference under certain conditions. (CVE-2017-12627)

 3.1.1-5.1+deb8u4 (Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:28:32 -0400) * Fix CVE-2017-12627: Alberto Garcia, Francisco Oca and Suleman Ali of Offensive Research discovered that the Xerces-C XML parser mishandles certain kinds of external DTD references, resulting in dereference of a NULL pointer while processing the path to the DTD. The bug allows for a denial of service attack in applications that allow DTD processing and do not prevent external DTD usage, and could conceivably result in remote code execution.
