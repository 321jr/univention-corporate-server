scope: ucs_4.1-0-errata4.1-4
src: nagios3
fix: 3.4.1-3.54.201612191342
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A stack-based buffer overflow in the cmd_submitf function in cgi/cmd.c
   in Nagios allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (segmentation fault) via a long message to cmd.cgi(CVE-2014-1878)
 * MagpieRSS, as used in the front-end component in Nagios Core might allow
   remote attackers to read or write to arbitrary files by spoofing a crafted
   response from the Nagios RSS feed server.  NOTE: this vulnerability
   exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-4796 (CVE-2016-9565)
 * base/logging.c in Nagios Core before 4.2.4 allows local users with access
   to an account in the nagios group to gain root privileges via a symlink
   attack on the log file.  NOTE: this can be leveraged by remote attackers
   using CVE-2016-9565 (CVE-2016-9566)
