fix: 0.2.1-6+deb8u2A~4.2.3.201801251012
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * rpcbind does not consider the maximum RPC data size during memory
   allocation for XDR strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (memory consumption with no subsequent free) via a crafted UDP
   packet to port 111, aka rpcbomb. (CVE-2017-8779)
