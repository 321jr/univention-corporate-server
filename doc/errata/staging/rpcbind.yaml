fix: 0.2.1-6+deb8u2A~4.2.4.201806141120
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When rpcbind is stopped, it returned a non-zero exit code,
   which causes systemd to assume that the service is in a
   failed state. During update to UCs 4.3 this can cause
   a problem for the new rpcbind.socket systemd unit, leaving
   the Debian package in an unconfigured state. The rpcbind
   program has been adjusted to return an exit code of 0,
   just like it does in UCS 4.3.
