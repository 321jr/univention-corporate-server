fix: 14.0.12-18A~4.4.0.201903271114
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * udm users/user create without --set username does not cause a exception
   anymore.
 * Various LDAP filters are now escaped.
 * The use of obsolete univention.admin.config has been removed.
 * The computers/* UDM handlers now share a common base class. Code
   redundancy has therefore been reduced.
 * The UMC now uses json instead of simplejson.
 * It is now possible again to modify the LDAP base, for example reference
   policies.  This was broken since UCS 4.3-0.
 * Default containers for domain controller computer objects can now be
   configured.
