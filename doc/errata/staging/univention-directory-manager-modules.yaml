desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Explicit initialization of the default values of UDM properties has been
   removed from the code of all UDM modules.
 * The users/user UDM module now uses the ldap filter
   "univentionObjectType=users/user" when searching for objects to increase
   performance.
