  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * Allow to customize portal with about page
  * It is now possible to define custom categories for the portal.
  * User Templates now have access to the alphanum option.
  * For performance reasons, UDM stores the last used value of uidNumber
    and gidNumber in an LDAP object in the univentionLastUsedValue
	attribute. Usually these two values are monotonously increasing with
	automatic assignment. When manually specifying the uidNumber/gidNumber
	when creating an object, however, this value could jump back to a lower
	value and previously used and now free values could be reused if
	necessary. This behavior has now been disabled. univentionLastUsedValue
	is now monotonously increasing (Bug #41109).
