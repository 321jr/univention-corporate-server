 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Extended options are now also evaluated for users/user objects.
 * The UDM command line tool now supports the use of '--remove' on single
   value attributes. Before '--set attribute=' had to be used.
 * Some old code which handled custom attributes has been removed.
 * The object class of extended options is now always added or removed to the
   object without the need to change an attribute.
 * The extended attribute option to remove the objectclass if it is no longer
   needed has been reenabled.
