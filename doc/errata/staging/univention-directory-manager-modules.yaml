 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The UDM module users/user now offers the following four new properties:
   initials, postOfficeBox, preferredLanguage and physicalDeliveryOfficeName.
   They are available via CLI tool and python API but not shown in the UMC.
 * The UDM module users/user properties departmentNumber and roomNumber
   have been changed to be multivalue, as allowed in the LDAP schema. This
   change has been made to support synchronization with Samba/AD.
