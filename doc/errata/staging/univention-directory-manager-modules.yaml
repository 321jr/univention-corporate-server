desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The UDM module users/user has been prepaired for adding the following
   four new properties:
   initials, postOfficeBox, preferredLanguage and physicalDeliveryOfficeName.
   Any extended attribute for those properties should be changed to use the
   same property name as CLIName.
 * The UDM module users/user properties departmentNumber and roomNumber
   have been changed to be multivalue, as allowed in the LDAP schema. This
   change has been made to support synchronization with Samba/AD.
 * The fallback language for extended attribute translations is now based
   on the primary language of the locale. Austrian German will then be
   translated in German instead of English.
