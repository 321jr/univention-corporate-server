  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The syntax check for the Base64GzipText attribute type had an error
    that made it impossible to store data in such an attribute.
  * The "simple" syntax class now allows None values to be able to e.g. remove
    the birthday of a user.
  * Some shell quoting errors were fixed.
  * Translation format strings with multiple unnamed arguments have been
    adjusted.
  * It is now possible to ship translations for UDM hooks and UDM syntax
    settings.
