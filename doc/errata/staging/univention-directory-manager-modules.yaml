fix: 
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * udm users/user create without --set username does not cause a exception
   anymore.
 * Various LDAP filters are now escaped.
 * The use of obsolete univention.admin.config has been removed.
 * The computers/* UDM handlers now share a common base class. Code
   redundancy has therefore been reduced.
 * The UMC now uses json instead of simplejson.
