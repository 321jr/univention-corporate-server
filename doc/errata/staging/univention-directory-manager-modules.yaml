 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Searching with an empty value for properties which weren't registered in
   any mapping lead to broken search filters.
 * Allow setting of RID to make the S4 connector able to sync the SID
   correctly.
 * The syntax check for DNS SOA/NS/PTR records has been improved. Host and
   domain names according to RFC1123 are now accepted.
