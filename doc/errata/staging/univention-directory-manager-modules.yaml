  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The syntax check for the Base64GzipText attribute type had an error
    that made it impossible to store data in such an attribute.
  * The "simple" syntax class now allows None values to be able to e.g. remove
    the birthday of a user.
  * Some shell quoting errors were fixed.
  * The modification list is now generated independent of the ordering of
    attribute values. This prevents errors when modifying objects in case the
    permissions of the executor aren't sufficient.
