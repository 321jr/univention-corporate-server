fix: 11.0.3-50.1444.201611301920
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Searching with an empty value for properties which weren't registered in
   any mapping lead to broken search filters.
 * Allow setting of RID to make the S4 connector able to sync the SID
   correctly.
 * The syntax check for DNS SOA/NS/PTR records has been improved. Host and
   domain names according to RFC1123 are now accepted.
 * When a group which is member of another group is renamed,
   the old group dn could me left over in the containing group
   if the spelling case found in the 'uniqueMember' attribute differed from the
   spelling case of the acutal group name. This can happen in combination
   with both AD-Connector and S4-Connector. Now the update of the
   'uniqueMember' attribute is performed in a case insensitive way.
