  This update addresses the following issue:
  * Internal improvement: Remove excessive log trace information from UDM
    modules method `__getitem__()`.
  * The Simple UDM API did not return an advanced list of DNs if the attribute
    was not set at all. It merely returned an empty list, which could lead to
    errors. This has been fixed.
