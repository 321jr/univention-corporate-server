desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Searching for IP addresses of DNS host records is now possible. The Zone
   Time-to-Live and Mail Exchanger properties of DNS objects aren't shown in
   the search field list anymore in UMC.
 * A crash of UDM is prevented which was caused by an extended attribute that
   overwrites a not existing layout group.
 * The object class univentionPolicyReference is now removed from objects when
   the last policy is dereferenced.
 * The search filter dnsAlias in the computer modules has been repaired.
 * Explicit initialization of the default values of UDM properties has been
   removed from the code of all UDM modules.
