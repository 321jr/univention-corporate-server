fix: 8:6.7.7.10-5.59.201605232004
desc: |
 This update fixes several vulnerabilities in ImageMagick. These
 vulnerabilities, collectively known as ImageTragick, are the consequence of
 lack of sanitization of untrusted input. An attacker with control on the
 image input could, with the privileges of the user running the application,
 execute code (CVE-2016-3714), make HTTP GET or FTP requests (CVE-2016-3718),
 or delete (CVE-2016-3715), move (CVE-2016-3716), or read (CVE-2016-3717)
 local files.
