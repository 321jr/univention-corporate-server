  * Fixed setting of userexpiry when a user account is disabled.
  * Fixed removal of the account expiry date of a user.
  * The user properties CtxBrokenSession and CtxReconnectSession now
    have default values. They prevented changes via UMC when not having
    sufficient LDAP permission to change these attributes. Especially
    affected were User Password Admins and the users/self module.
  * The univention.admin.uexception.base class provides now more detailed
    information about the error cause.
  * Error handling of UDM modules has been improved by adding default methods
    which contain information about the current edited object type.
  * The "Release" policy have been renamed into "Automatic updates" and its
    property descriptions have been adapted to be more understandable.
  * Remove references to the network object when deleting it.
