  * Fixed setting of userexpiry when a user account is disabled.
  * Fixed removal of the account expiry date of a user.
  * The user properties ctxBrokenSession and ctxReconnectSession now
    have default values. They prevented changes via UMC when not having
    sufficient LDAP permission to change these attributes. Especially
    affected were User Password Admins and the users/self module.
  * The internal method get_exception_msg() has been moved into the base
    class of UDM exceptions.
  * Error handling of UDM modules has been improoved by adding default methods
    which contain information about the current edited object type.
