fix: 
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The package now uses dh_python2 instead of python-support.
   Therefore python modules are installed into
   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/univention/management/console/.
 * The LDAP service is not restarted anymore on every change of the
   univentionService attribute for any computer object in the domain.
