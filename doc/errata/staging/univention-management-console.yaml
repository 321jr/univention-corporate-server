 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Using UMC was not possible with multiple docker instances on the system
   was not possible as the browser then sends multiple cookies which caused
   that the correct session was not detected.
 * The error handling and logging in case the identity provider for 
   single sign-on is wrong or not configured has been improved.
