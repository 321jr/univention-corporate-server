  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * SAML answers do not provide a usable password for UMC. Some UMC actions
    require specifically this password and so the UMC frontend asks for
    credentials before executing them. This fix stores the password across
    different UMC modules so that users need to enter their password only once
    per session.
