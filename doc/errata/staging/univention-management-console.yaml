 This update addresses the following issues:
 * SAML answers do not provide a usable password for UMC. Some UMC actions
   require specifically this password and so the UMC frontend asks for
   credentials before executing them. This fix stores the password across
   different UMC modules so that users need to enter their password only once
   per session.
 * The "How do I login?" link on the login page can now be configured via
   the umc/login/links/how_do_i_login/.* UCR variables.
