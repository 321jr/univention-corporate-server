desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The LDAP connections are reestablished in the UMC-Web-Server after
   a server password change. This causes that the correct portal entries
   for authenticated users are shown again.
 * pam_cracklib has been removed from the UMC pam configuration.
   Therefore password changes do not require strong passwords anymore if no
   passord policy is defined in the environment.
