desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A custom css file for manual style changes was added to the univention login
 * The UMC-Server does not respond with an error anymore if no English
   locale is configured.
 * LDAP connection problems could result in an error loop, with the following
   error "ldapError: Insufficient access". This has been fixed by ensuring a
   new connection is used after LDAP connection problems.
