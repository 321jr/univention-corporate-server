desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * It is now possible to navigate to an UMC module without the overview
   of all UMC modules and have only that UMC module open.
   This can be achieved for example with:
   https://fqdn/univention/management/#singlemodule=true&module=setup:network
 * The Content-Security-Policy for UMC and its login dialog is now
   configurable via UCR. The X-Frame-Options default header has been replaced
   with the Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestor setting.
