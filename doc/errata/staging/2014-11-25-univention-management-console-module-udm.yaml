  * A notification for AD objects (e.g. user/groups) will only be
    shown once per session
  * The error message if the connection to the LDAP server fails
    has been extended
  * The UMCP command udm/layout failed if a DN was given which could not
    be identified as UDM object
  * The get_exception_method has been removed. Error information are now
    provided by the UDM base exception itself
  * Exceptions are not re-raised anymore as this hides important error
    information in traceback feedback reports
