  * A notification for AD objects (e.g. user/groups) will only be
    shown once per session
  * The error message if the connection to the LDAP server fails
    has been extended.
  * The UMCP command udm/layout failed if a DN was given which could not
    be identified as UDM object.
  * The get_exception_method has been removed. Error information are now
    provided by the UDM base exception itself.
  * Exceptions are not re-raised anymore as this hides important error
    information in traceback feedback reports.
  * After changing the own password a login dialog is shown if a LDAP
    connection needs to be reestablished.
  * It is now prevented that a search with a given attribute name can raise
    a bad search filter exception.
  * The search form does not allow invalid values to be submitted anymore.
  * Users without posix option are now able to use the UMC module.
  * A error message is now shown if the DN of a user could not be determined.
