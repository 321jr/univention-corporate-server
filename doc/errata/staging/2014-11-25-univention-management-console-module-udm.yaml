desc: |
  * The notification while changing objects which are part of a Active
    Directory domain has been placed in a more visible area.
  * The error message if the connection to the LDAP server fails
    has been extended.
  * The UMCP command udm/layout failed if a DN was given which could not
    be identified as UDM object.
  * The get_exception_method has been removed. Error information are now
    provided by the UDM base exception itself.
  * Exceptions are not re-raised anymore as this hides important error
    information in traceback feedback reports.
  * After changing the own password a login dialog is shown if a LDAP
    connection needs to be reestablished.
  * It is now prevented that a search with a given attribute name can raise
    a bad search filter exception.
  * The search form does not allow invalid values to be submitted anymore.
  * Users without posix option are now able to use the UMC module.
  * A error message is now shown if the DN of a user could not be determined.
  * Searching for an invalid object type will not raise an exception
    anymore.
  * Opening a nonexistent object (e.g. object was moved / deleted)
    now shows an error message instead of raising an exception.
