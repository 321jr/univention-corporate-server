desc: |
  This errata update fixes the following issues in the package univention-s4-connector:
  * A server password change script has been added. The S4 connector will be restarted
    in case it uses the machine account.
  * The S4 connector now considers the scenario that an object was moved to a position
    which is not replicated to this server. This is for example the case in UCS@school.
