desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Due to a race condition, the `memberOf` attribute of user objects could
   have been incomplete on domaincontroller backup and domaincontroller
   slave systems. This problem has now been fixed. To get all user objects
   back in sync, the script
   /usr/share/univention-ldap-overlay-memberof/univention-update-memberof
   should be called once on every UCS domaincontroller.
