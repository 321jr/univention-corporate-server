fix: 2.1.3-2.22.201508311636
desc: |
 The following issues have been fixed:
 * OpenVPN clients using TLS authentication could crash the server by
   sending a malicious control channel packet to the server, resulting
   in denial of service (CVE-2014-8104).
 * When running in UDP mode, OpenVPN allows remote attackers to obtain
   sensitive information via a timing attack involving an HMAC comparison
   function that does not run in constant time and a padding oracle attack
   on the CBC mode cipher (CVE-2013-2061).
