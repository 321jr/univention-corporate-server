fix: 13.0.0-29A~4.4.0.202001291041
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * It is now possible to filter out users from synchronization by setting the
   UCR variable `connector/ad/mapping/user/ignorefilter` to an LDAP filter.
   Every user matched by this LDAP filter will be ignored by the connector.
 * Fix python library path in `prepare-new-instance`. This fixes the feature
   to synchronize several Active Directory domains with one UCS directory
   service.
