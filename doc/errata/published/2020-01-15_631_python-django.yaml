 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Django allows account takeover: A suitably crafted email address (that is
   equal to an existing user's email address after case transformation of
   Unicode characters) would allow an attacker to be sent a password reset
   token for the matched user account. One mitigation in the new releases is
   to send password reset tokens only to the registered user email address.
