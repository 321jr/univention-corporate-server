desc: |
 These vulnerabilities have been fixed:
 * CVE-2014-9705
   Heap-based buffer overflow in the enchant_broker_request_dict
   function in ext/enchant/enchant.c in PHP before 5.4.38, 5.5.x
   before 5.5.22, and 5.6.x before 5.6.6 allows remote attackers
   to execute arbitrary code via vectors that trigger creation of
   multiple dictionaries.
 * CVE-2015-0232
   The exif_process_unicode function in ext/exif/exif.c in PHP
   before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5
   allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
   denial of service (uninitialized pointer free and application
   crash) via crafted EXIF data in a JPEG image.
 * CVE-2015-2301
   Use-after-free vulnerability in the phar_rename_archive function
   in phar_object.c in PHP before 5.5.22 and 5.6.x before 5.6.6
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
   have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an attempted
   renaming of a Phar archive to the name of an existing file.
 * CVE-2015-2331
   Integer overflow in the _zip_cdir_new function in zip_dirent.c
   in libzip 0.11.2 and earlier, as used in the ZIP extension in PHP
   before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 and
   other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
   via a ZIP archive that contains many entries, leading to a
   heap-based buffer overflow.
 * CVE-2015-2783
   Buffer Over-read in unserialize when parsing Phar
 * CVE-2015-2787
   Use-after-free vulnerability in the process_nested_data function
   in ext/standard/var_unserializer.re in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x
   before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 allows remote attackers to
   execute arbitrary code via a crafted unserialize call that
   leverages use of the unset function within an __wakeup function,
   a related issue to CVE-2015-0231.
 * CVE-2015-3329
   Buffer Overflow when parsing tar/zip/phar in phar_set_inode)
 * CVE-2015-3330
   PHP potential remote code execution with apache 2.4 apache2handler
 * CVE-2015-temp-68819.patch
   denial of service when processing a crafted file with Fileinfo
 * CVE-2014-0238
   The cdf_read_property_info function in cdf.c in the Fileinfo
   component in PHP before 5.4.29 and 5.5.x before 5.5.13 allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop
   or out-of-bounds memory access) via a vector that (1) has zero
   length or (2) is too long.
 * CVE-2014-0237
   The cdf_unpack_summary_info function in cdf.c in the Fileinfo
   component in PHP before 5.4.29 and 5.5.x before 5.5.13 allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (performance
   degradation) by triggering many file_printf calls.
 * CVE-2014-2270
   softmagic.c in file before 5.17 and libmagic allows context
   dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
   memory access and crash) via crafted offsets in the softmagic
   of a PE executable.
 * CVE-2014-8117
   Stop reporting bad capabilities after the first few.
   limit the number of program and section header number of sections
   limit recursion level
 * CVE-2014-3668
   Fix bug #68027 - fix date parsing in XMLRPC lib
 * CVE-2014-3669
   Fixed bug #68044: Integer overflow in unserialize() (32-bits only)
 * CVE-2014-3670
   Fix bug #68113 (Heap corruption in exif_thumbnail())
 * CVE-2014-3710
   Fix bug #68283: fileinfo: out-of-bounds read in elf note headers
 * CVE-2014-3538
   extensive backtracking in rule regular expression
 * CVE-2014-3597
   Segfault in dns_get_record (PHP#67717)
 * CVE-2014-3587
   Segfault in cdf.c (PHP#67716)
 * CVE-2014-3515
   fix unserialize() SPL ArrayObject / SPLObjectStorage Type Confusion
 * CVE-2014-0207
   fileinfo: cdf_read_short_sector insufficient boundary check
 * CVE-2014-3480
   fileinfo: cdf_count_chain insufficient boundary check
 * CVE-2014-4721
   The phpinfo implementation in ext/standard/info.c in PHP before
   5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14 does not ensure use of the string
   data type for the PHP_AUTH_PW, PHP_AUTH_TYPE, PHP_AUTH_USER, and
   PHP_SELF variables, which might allow context-dependent attackers
   to obtain sensitive information from process memory by using the
   integer data type with crafted values, related to a "type
   confusion" vulnerability, as demonstrated by reading a private SSL
   key in an Apache HTTP Server web-hosting environment with mod_ssl
   and a PHP 5.3.x mod_php.
 * CVE-2014-4029
 * CVE-2014-1943
   Fix segmentation fault in libmagic (Closes: #739012)
