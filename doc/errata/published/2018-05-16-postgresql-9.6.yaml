 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Ensure that all temporary files made by pg_upgrade are non-world-readable
   (CVE-2018-1053)
 * Change the behavior of contrib/cube's cube ~> int operator to make it
   compatible with KNN search. The meaning of the second argument (the
   dimension selector) has been changed to make it predictable which value is
   selected even when dealing with cubes of varying dimensionalities. This is
   an incompatible change, but since the point of the operator was to be used
   in KNN searches, it seems rather useless as-is. After installing this
   update, any expression indexes or materialized views using this operator
   will need to be reindexed/refreshed.
