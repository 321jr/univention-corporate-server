version: [0]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The free disc space requirement in the updater's "preup" script has been
   increased to 1.5GiB.
 * The AWS EC2 image "Univention Corporate Server (UCS) 4.1 (official
   image) rev. 0" uses the repository server
   "updates-test.software-univention.de" instead of
   "updates.software-univention.de".
   This update resets the UCR variable repository/online/server on EC2
   images to "updates.software-univention.de".
 * The layout in the UMC software update module has been adjusted to be
   responsive.
