version: [5]
desc: |
  This update addresses the following issue:
  * The msgpo.schema file adjusted in UCS 3.2-5 erratum 276 would get replaced
    by a not-adjusted version during an update to UCS 4.0. This erratum
    avoids this by implementing a dpkg diversion for that file, which will
    get removed again in an erratum for UCS 4.0-2.

erratum: 335
