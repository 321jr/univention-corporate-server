desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Is is now possible to restrict negotiate authentication to certain IP
   networks via the UCR variable saml/idp/negotiate/filter-subnets.
 * The package now uses dh_python2 instead of python-support.
   Therefore python modules are installed into
   /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/univention/admin/handlers/.
 * The UDM modules saml/idpconfig and saml/serviceprovider have been
   modernized.
