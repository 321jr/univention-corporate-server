fix: 13.0.0-44A~4.4.0.202006222157
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The flag pwdChangeNextLogin is now synced bidirectionally
   by the adconnector
 * The Diff-Mode synchronization technique originally implemented
   for the S4-Connector has been merged to the AD-Connector.
   This affects the replication of multivalue attribute values
   such that only added and removed attribute values are modified
   on the destination system, but values unchanged on the source of
   replication are also unchanged on the destination. Before
   this update, all values of an attribute changed in the source LDAP
   got replaced in the destination LDAP. Please note that there
   is no change in the replication of group memberships, because
   they already have been replicated in Diff-Mode before.
 * Ignore changes to a list of irrelevant attributes.
   The list can be extended via a new UCR variable
   connector/ad/mapping/attributes/irrelevant
 * Basic profiling support via UCR connector/ad/poll/profiling
 * Log the active mapping on startup
