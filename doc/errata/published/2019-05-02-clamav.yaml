 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning
   functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software could allow an
   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
   condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of
   proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while indexing
   remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this
   vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected device. A
   successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap buffer
   out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a
   denial of service condition on an affected device. (CVE-2019-1787)
 * A vulnerability in the Object Linking & Embedding (OLE2) file scanning
   functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software could allow an
   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on
   an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input and
   validation checking mechanisms for OLE2 files sent an affected device. An
   attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed OLE2 files
   to the device running an affected version ClamAV Software. An exploit could
   allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds write condition, resulting in
   a crash that could result in a denial of service condition on an affected
   device. (CVE-2019-1788)
 * An out-of-bounds heap read condition may occur when scanning PE files (i.e.
   Windows EXE and DLL files) that have been packed using Aspack as a result
   of inadequate bound-checking. (CVE-2019-1789)
