 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource
   record-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
   compressed labels in mDNS messages, the compression pointer is followed
   without checking for recursion, leading to a denial of service. An attacker
   can send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2020-6071)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the label-parsing
   functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing compressed
   labels in mDNS messages, the rr_decode function's return value is not
   checked, leading to a double free that could be exploited to execute
   arbitrary code. An attacker can send an mDNS message to trigger this
   vulnerability. (CVE-2020-6072)
 * An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the TXT
   record-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
   the RDATA section in a TXT record in mDNS messages, multiple integer
   overflows can be triggered, leading to a denial of service. An attacker can
   send an mDNS message to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2020-6073)
 * An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
   message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
   mDNS messages, the implementation does not properly keep track of the
   available data in the message, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds read
   that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS
   message to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2020-6077)
 * An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
   message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
   mDNS messages in mdns_recv, the return value of the mdns_read_header
   function is not checked, leading to an uninitialized variable usage that
   eventually results in a null pointer dereference, leading to service crash.
   An attacker can send a series of mDNS messages to trigger this
   vulnerability. (CVE-2020-6078)
 * An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource
   allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering
   errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed,
   possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion.
   An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this
   vulnerability through decoding of the domain name performed by rr_decode.
   (CVE-2020-6079)
 * An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource
   allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering
   errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed,
   possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion.
   An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this
   vulnerability through the function rr_read_RR [5] reads the current
   resource record, except for the RDATA section. This is read by the loop at
   in rr_read. For each RR type, a different function is called. When the RR
   type is 0x10, the function rr_read_TXT is called at [6]. (CVE-2020-6080)
