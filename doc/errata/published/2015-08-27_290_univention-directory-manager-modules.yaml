 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In previous versions the user's display name has only been set
   automatically during user creation. When the first name or last name has
   been changed later on, the display name of the user has not been updated.
   Starting from this erratum, the display name is updated automatically upon
   change of first or last name if the display name contains still the default
   value that has been automatically created. If the display name has been
   altered manually and does not match the "default value", no automatic
   update is performed.
