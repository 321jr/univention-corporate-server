desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The UMC grid can now allow the execution of an action even though
    some of the selected items are not executable with regard to the
    action.
  * A function has been added to reload the modules of the overview
    tab on the fly.
  * A default link to UMC has been added on the UCS overview page for
    unjoined systems
  * When installing a new system which is neither a master domain controller
    master nor a backup domain controller backup, the UMC entry in the
    UCS overview page will no longer consider the UMC a domain
    administration tool, as the domain modules are only available on
    master and backup systems.
  * A timeout problem in the UMC web server has been fixed.
