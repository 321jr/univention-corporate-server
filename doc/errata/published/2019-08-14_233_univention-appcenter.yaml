 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Multicontainer Apps now use a subnet managed by the App Center instead of
   creating arbitrary networks. This caused problems with firewalls and
   existing networks. The network can be configured by the UCR variable
   appcenter/docker/compose/network, which defaults to 172.16.1.1/16. This
   change takes effect with new App installations.
