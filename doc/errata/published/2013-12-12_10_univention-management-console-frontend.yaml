  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Requests to outdated UMC web files (such as images, HTML files, JavaScript
    source files) are now redirected in order to avoid problems in the
    representation.
  * Fixed rendering of the "Activate UCS" dialog in Internet Explorer 9 and 10.
  * This update corrects the generation of overview links. The links
    are now generated in the join script. This ensures that
    host and domain identifiers match the current settings in case of
    a rejoin and after completing the appliance setup.
  * The progress bar does not have a transition anymore if the value is
    "indeterminate".
