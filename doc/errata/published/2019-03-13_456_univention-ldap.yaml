desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Fix regression in `cn=translog` setup, which reset the LDAP indices. If an
   UCS-4.3 system was updated to erratum 426 before this erratum was made
   available, the list of indexed LDAP attributes was reset to the
   default on master and backup systems. This may lead to slow LDAP searches.
   If other attributes were added manually to the UCR variables
   'ldap/index/eq', 'ldap/index/sub', 'ldap/index/pres', they must be
   restored manually. The old values might be recovered from the log file
   '/var/log/univention/config-registry.replog'. After a manual change of
   these UCR variables, the LDAP server indices need to be updated by stopping
   the slapd service, then running the script
   /usr/share/univention-ldap/ldap_setup_index
   and starting the slapd service again.
