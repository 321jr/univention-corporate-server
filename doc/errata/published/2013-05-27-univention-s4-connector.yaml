  This errata update fixes two issues in the package univention-s4-connector:
  * Samba4 DCs are now added to the group Enterprise Domain Controllers
    This will become important for sysvol replication in upcoming UCS releases.
  * The attribute sambaMaxPwdAge can be set to -1 in OpenLDAP. This will now
    be mapped to 0 in Samba 4.
