desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 On UCS systems booting via BIOS, GRUB would not be correctly
 updated, if debconf grub-pc/install_devices is empty.

 Additionally an error would happen if grub-pc/install_devices
 contains a wrong device.
 If it contains a wrong device the GRUB installation happens but
 fails, leading to an inconsistent installation between /boot/grub and
 the GRUB directly on the disk.
 This makes the system unbootable.

 This update checks all devices in grub-pc/install_devices, removing
 invalid devices.

 A guess is made for the correct boot device which will be added to
 grub-pc/install_devices if grub-pc/install_devices is currently empty
 or there were invalid devices.

 If any changes were made, grub-install is run on all devices in
 grub-pc/install_devices.
