fix: 2:3.6.8-1.565.201305061531
version: [1]
desc: |
  This errata update fixes two bugs in the package samba:
  * The current Samba 3 build does not support quota on XFS file systems as
  expected. This new Samba build supports quota on XFS.
  * The winbind init script did not ensure that the daemon actually got stopped.
  This could lead to a non-running winbind daemon after the server password change.
