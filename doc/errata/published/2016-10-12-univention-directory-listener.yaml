 This update addresses the following issue:
 * When objects were moved to a subtree protected by LDAP access control
   lists, the listener modules using modrdn='1' were only called once with the
   original command='r' to signal the first phase of the move operation. They
   were not called again for the second phase with command='a' as the Listener
   cache entry was already deleted during the first phase and the modules were
   no longer associated with that entry.
   The Listener now calls the modules with command='d' to signal a deletion.
