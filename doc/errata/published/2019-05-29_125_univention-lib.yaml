 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The package now uses dh_python2 instead of python-support.
   Therefore python modules are installed into

 * A path traversal vulnerability in the ldap_extension.py listener
   utilities has been fixed.
 * Log stderr if LDAP schema validation fails.
 * A symlink and code execution vulnerabiliy has been fixed in
   univention.lib.listenerSharePath.
