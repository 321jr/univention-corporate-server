desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A remote attacker may send a crafted packet triggering a stack-based buffer
   overflow due to an insecurely implemented strncpy call. The vulnerability
   is triggered by sending an error packet of 3 bytes or fewer. There are
   multiple instances of this vulnerable strncpy pattern within the code base.
   (CVE-2019-11365)
 * atftpd does not lock the thread_list_mutex mutex before assigning the
   current thread data structure. As a result, the daemon is vulnerable to a
   denial of service attack due to a NULL pointer dereference. If thread_data
   is NULL when assigned to current, and modified by another thread before a
   certain tftpd_list.c check, there is a crash when dereferencing
   current->next. (CVE-2019-11366)
