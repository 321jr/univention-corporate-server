fix: 7:3.2.14-1~deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The flv_write_packet function in libavformat/flvenc.c does not check for an
   empty audio packet, leading to an assertion failure. (CVE-2018-15822)
 * FFmpeg contains a Buffer Overflow vulnerability in asf_o format demuxer
   that can result in heap-buffer-overflow that may result in remote code
   execution. This attack appears to be exploitable via specially crafted ASF
   file that has to be provided as input to FFmpeg.  (CVE-2018-1999011)
 * Denial of service in subtitle decoder allows attackers to hog CPU via
   crafted video file (CVE-2019-9718)
 * libavcodec/hevcdec.c mishandles detection of duplicate first slices, which
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
   dereference and out-of-array access) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via crafted HEVC data. (CVE-2019-11338)
