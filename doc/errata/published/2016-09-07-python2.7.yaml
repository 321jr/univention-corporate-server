desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A vulnerability in smtplib allowing MITM attacker to perform a
   startTLS stripping attack. smtplib does not seem to raise an
   exception when the remote end (smtp server) is capable of
   negotiating starttls but fails to respond with 220 (ok) to an
   explicit call of SMTP.starttls(). This may allow a malicious MITM
   to perform a startTLS stripping attack if the client code does not
   explicitly check the response code for startTLS (CVE-2016-0772)
 * Issue #26171: Fix possible integer overflow and heap corruption in
   zipimporter.get_data() (CVE-2016-5636)
 * Protocol injection can occur not only if an application sets a
   header based on user-supplied values, but also if the application
   ever tries to fetch a URL specified by an attacker (SSRF case) OR
   if the application ever accesses any malicious web server
   (redirection case) (CVE-2016-5699)
