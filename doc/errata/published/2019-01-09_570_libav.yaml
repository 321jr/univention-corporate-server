desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The decode_ihdr_chunk function in libavcodec/pngdec.c before allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap access) and
   possibly have other unspecified impact via an IDAT before an IHDR in a PNG
   file. (CVE-2014-9317)
 * Memory corruption in FFMpeg (CVE-2015-6761)
 * The decode_ihdr_chunk function in libavcodec/pngdec.c does not enforce
   uniqueness of the IHDR (aka image header) chunk in a PNG image, which
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array
   access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image with
   two or more of these chunks. (CVE-2015-6818)
 * The ff_sbr_apply function in libavcodec/aacsbr.c does not check for a
   matching AAC frame syntax element before proceeding with Spectral Band
   Replication calculations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via crafted AAC data. (CVE-2015-6820)
 * The ff_mpv_common_init function in libavcodec/mpegvideo.c does not properly
   maintain the encoding context, which allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (invalid pointer access) or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via crafted MPEG data. (CVE-2015-6821)
 * The destroy_buffers function in libavcodec/sanm.c does not properly
   maintain height and width values in the video context, which allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation and
   application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted
   LucasArts Smush video data. (CVE-2015-6822)
 * The allocate_buffers function in libavcodec/alac.c does not initialize
   certain context data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (segmentation violation) or possibly have unspecified other impact
   via crafted Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC) data. (CVE-2015-6823)
 * The sws_init_context function in libswscale/utils.c does not initialize
   certain pixbuf data structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (segmentation violation) or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via crafted video data. (CVE-2015-6824)
 * The ff_frame_thread_init function in libavcodec/pthread_frame.c mishandles
   certain memory-allocation failures, which allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (invalid pointer access) or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by an AVI file.
   (CVE-2015-6825)
 * The ff_rv34_decode_init_thread_copy function in libavcodec/rv34.c does not
   initialize certain structure members, which allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (invalid pointer access) or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via crafted (1) RV30 or (2) RV40 RealVideo data.
   (CVE-2015-6826)
 * The ljpeg_decode_yuv_scan function in libavcodec/mjpegdec.c omits certain
   width and height checks, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via crafted MJPEG data. (CVE-2015-8216)
 * The ff_hevc_parse_sps function in libavcodec/hevc_ps.c does not validate
   the Chroma Format Indicator, which allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified
   other impact via crafted High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) data.
   (CVE-2015-8217)
 * The jpeg2000_read_main_headers function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dec.c 2.7.x
   does not enforce uniqueness of the SIZ marker in a JPEG 2000 image, which
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
   heap-memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   image with two or more of these markers. (CVE-2015-8363)
 * Integer overflow in the ff_ivi_init_planes function in libavcodec/ivi.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
   heap-memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted
   image dimensions in Indeo Video Interactive data. (CVE-2015-8364)
 * The h264_slice_header_init function in libavcodec/h264_slice.c does not
   validate the relationship between the number of threads and the number of
   slices, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
   crafted H.264 data. (CVE-2015-8661)
 * The ff_dwt_decode function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dwt.c does not validate
   the number of decomposition levels before proceeding with Discrete Wavelet
   Transform decoding, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data. (CVE-2015-8662)
 * The ff_get_buffer function in libavcodec/utils.c preserves width and height
   values after a failure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted .mov file. (CVE-2015-8663)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in libavformat/http.c allows remote web servers
   to execute arbitrary code via a negative chunk size in an HTTP response.
   (CVE-2016-10190)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in libavformat/rtmppkt.c allows remote attackers
   to execute arbitrary code by leveraging failure to check for RTMP packet
   size mismatches. (CVE-2016-10191)
