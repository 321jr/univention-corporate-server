desc: |-
 This update of the Linux kernel to 3.10.107 addresses the following issues:
 * Xen, when used on a system providing PV backends, allows local guest OS
   administrators to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or gain
   privileges by writing to memory shared between the frontend and backend,
   aka a double fetch vulnerability (CVE-2015-8550)
 * The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using
   Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest
   administrators to hit BUG conditions and cause a denial of service (NULL
   pointer dereference and host OS crash) by leveraging a system with access
   to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device and a crafted
   sequence of XEN_PCI_OP_* operations, aka "Linux pciback missing sanity
   checks." (CVE-2015-8551)
 * The tty_set_termios_ldisc function in drivers/tty/tty_ldisc.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.5 allows local users to obtain sensitive information from
   kernel memory by reading a tty data structure (CVE-2015-8964)
 * crypto/algif_skcipher.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4.2 does not verify
   that a setkey operation has been performed on an AF_ALG socket before an
   accept system call is processed, which allows local users to cause a denial
   of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted
   application that does not supply a key, related to the lrw_crypt function
   in crypto/lrw.c (CVE-2015-8970)
 * Xen and the Linux kernel through 4.5.x do not properly suppress hugetlbfs
   support in x86 PV guests, which allows local PV guest OS users to cause a
   denial of service (guest OS crash) by attempting to access a hugetlbfs
   mapped area (CVE-2016-3961)
 * The tcp_check_send_head function in include/net/tcp.h in the Linux kernel
   before 4.7.5 does not properly maintain certain SACK state after a failed
   data copy, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
   (tcp_xmit_retransmit_queue use-after-free and system crash) via a crafted
   SACK option (CVE-2016-6828)
 * The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel
   through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is
   enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption
   and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file (CVE-2016-7042)
 * The arcmsr_iop_message_xfer function in drivers/scsi/arcmsr/arcmsr_hba.c in
   the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 does not restrict a certain length field,
   which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
   (heap-based buffer overflow) via an ARCMSR_MESSAGE_WRITE_WQBUFFER control
   code (CVE-2016-7425)
 * drivers/firewire/net.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7, in certain unusual
   hardware configurations, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
   via crafted fragmented packets (CVE-2016-8633)
 * The TCP stack in the Linux kernel before 4.8.10 mishandles skb truncation,
   which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a
   crafted application that makes sendto system calls, related to
   net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c and net/ipv6/tcp_ipv6.c (CVE-2016-8645)
 * The mpi_powm function in lib/mpi/mpi-pow.c in the Linux kernel through
   4.8.11 does not ensure that memory is allocated for limb data, which allows
   local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and
   panic) via an add_key system call for an RSA key with a zero exponent
   (CVE-2016-8650)
 * Stack-based buffer overflow in the brcmf_cfg80211_start_ap function in
   drivers/net/wireless/broadcom/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.7.5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system
   crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long SSID
   Information Element in a command to a Netlink socket (CVE-2016-8658)
 * The sctp_sf_ootb function in net/sctp/sm_statefuns.c in the Linux kernel
   before 4.8.8 lacks chunk-length checking for the first chunk, which allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds slab access)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted SCTP data
   (CVE-2016-9555)
 * Race condition in the snd_pcm_period_elapsed function in
   sound/core/pcm_lib.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.7
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
   SNDRV_PCM_TRIGGER_START command (CVE-2016-9794)
 * The dccp_rcv_state_process function in net/dccp/input.c in the Linux kernel
   through 4.9.11 mishandles DCCP_PKT_REQUEST packet data structures in the
   LISTEN state, which allows local users to obtain root privileges or cause a
   denial of service (double free) via an application that makes an
   IPV6_RECVPKTINFO setsockopt system call (CVE-2017-6074)
 * Linux drivers/char/lp.c Out-of-Bounds Write. Due to a missing bounds check,
   and the fact that parport_ptr integer is static, a 'secure boot' kernel
   command line adversary (can happen due to bootloader vulns, e.g. Google
   Nexus 6's CVE-2016-10277, where due to a vulnerability the adversary has
   partial control over the command line) can overflow the parport_nr array in
   the following code, by appending many (>LP_NO) 'lp=none' arguments to the
   command line (CVE-2017-1000363)
 * The inet_csk_clone_lock function in net/ipv4/inet_connection_sock.c in the
   Linux kernel through 4.10.15 allows attackers to cause a denial of service
   (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use
   of the accept system call (CVE-2017-8890)

   free) by setting the HDLC line discipline (CVE-2017-2636)
 * net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.1 does not properly
   restrict association peel-off operations during certain wait states, which
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid unlock and double
   free) via a multithreaded application. NOTE: this vulnerability exists
   because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5986 (CVE-2017-6353)
 * Race condition in the sctp_wait_for_sndbuf function in net/sctp/socket.c in
   the Linux kernel before 4.9.11 allows local users to cause a denial of
   service (assertion failure and panic) via a multithreaded application that
   peels off an association in a certain buffer-full state (CVE-2017-5986)
 * The xc2028_set_config function in drivers/media/tuners/tuner-xc2028.c in
   the Linux kernel before 4.6 allows local users to gain privileges or cause
   a denial of service (use-after-free) via vectors involving omission of the
   firmware name from a certain data structure (CVE-2016-7913)
 * The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel through
   4.10.8 is too late in obtaining a certain lock and consequently cannot
   ensure that disconnect function calls are safe, which allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging access to the protocol
   value of IPPROTO_ICMP in a socket system call (CVE-2017-2671)
 * drivers/net/usb/rtl8150.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.11 interacts
   incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly
   have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual
   page for a DMA scatterlist (CVE-2017-8068, CVE-2017-8069)
 * The edge_bulk_in_callback function in drivers/usb/serial/io_ti.c in the
   Linux kernel before 4.10.4 allows local users to obtain sensitive
   information (in the dmesg ringbuffer and syslog) from uninitialized kernel
   memory by using a crafted USB device (posing as an io_ti USB serial device)
   to trigger an integer underflow (CVE-2017-8924)
 * The iowarrior_probe function in drivers/usb/misc/iowarrior.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.5.1 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial
   of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted
   endpoints value in a USB device descriptor (CVE-2016-2188)
 * The omninet_open function in drivers/usb/serial/omninet.c in the Linux
   kernel before 4.10.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (tty
   exhaustion) by leveraging reference count mishandling (CVE-2017-8925)
 * Race condition in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.13
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a multithreaded application that
   makes PACKET_FANOUT setsockopt system calls (CVE-2017-6346)
 * The ip6gre_err function in net/ipv6/ip6_gre.c in the Linux kernel allows
   remote attackers to have unspecified impact via vectors involving GRE flags
   in an IPv6 packet, which trigger an out-of-bounds access (CVE-2017-5897)
 * The ipv4_pktinfo_prepare function in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux
   kernel through 4.9.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (system
   crash) via (1) an application that makes crafted system calls or possibly
   (2) IPv4 traffic with invalid IP options (CVE-2017-5970)
 * The klsi_105_get_line_state function in drivers/usb/serial/kl5kusb105.c in
   the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 places uninitialized heap-memory contents
   into a log entry upon a failure to read the line status, which allows local
   users to obtain sensitive information by reading the log (CVE-2017-5549)
 * fs/ext4/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.2, when ext4 data=ordered
   mode is used, mishandles a needs-flushing-before-commit list, which allows
   local users to obtain sensitive information from other users' files in
   opportunistic circumstances by waiting for a hardware reset, creating a new
   file, making write system calls, and reading this file (CVE-2017-7495)
 * The KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.10.13 allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of
   KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring calls
   (CVE-2017-7472)
 * The keyring_search_aux function in security/keys/keyring.c in the Linux
   kernel through 3.14.79 allows local users to cause a denial of service
   (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a request_key system call for the
   "dead" type (CVE-2017-6951)
 * The built-in keyrings for security tokens can be joined as a session and
   then modified by the root user (CVE-2016-9604)
 * The xfrm_replay_verify_len function in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c in the Linux
   kernel through 4.10.6 does not validate certain size data after an
   XFRM_MSG_NEWAE update, which allows local users to obtain root privileges
   or cause a denial of service (heap-based out-of-bounds access) by
   leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, as demonstrated during a Pwn2Own
   competition at CanSecWest 2017 for the Ubuntu 16.10 linux-image-* package
   4.8.0.41.52 (CVE-2017-7184)
 * The tcp_splice_read function in net/ipv4/tcp.c in the Linux kernel before
   4.9.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop
   and soft lockup) via vectors involving a TCP packet with the URG flag
   (CVE-2017-6214)
 * Off-by-one error in selinux_setprocattr (/proc/self/attr/fscreate)
   (CVE-2017-2618)
 * An information disclosure vulnerability in kernel components including the
   ION subsystem, Binder, USB driver and networking subsystem could enable a
   local malicious application to access data outside of its permission
   levels. This issue is rated as Moderate because it first requires
   compromising a privileged process. Product: Android. Versions: Kernel-3.10,
   Kernel-3.18. Android ID: A-31651010 (CVE-2016-8405)
 * The simple_set_acl function in fs/posix_acl.c in the Linux kernel before
   4.9.6 preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call involving a tmpfs
   filesystem, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging
   the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.
   NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
   CVE-2016-7097 (CVE-2017-5551)
 * The filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2 preserves
   the setgid bit during a setxattr call, which allows local users to gain
   group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with
   restrictions on execute permissions (CVE-2016-7097)
 * arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.3 allows local users
   to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of
   service (use-after-free) via a crafted application that leverages
   instruction emulation for fxrstor, fxsave, sgdt, and sidt (CVE-2017-2584)
 * The load_segment_descriptor implementation in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the
   Linux kernel before 4.9.5 improperly emulates a "MOV SS, NULL selector"
   instruction, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service
   (guest OS crash) or gain guest OS privileges via a crafted application
   (CVE-2017-2583)
 * The evm_verify_hmac function in security/integrity/evm/evm_main.c in the
   Linux kernel before 4.5 does not properly copy data, which makes it easier
   for local users to forge MAC values via a timing side-channel attack
   (CVE-2016-2085)
 * Race condition in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.12
   allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service
   (use-after-free) by leveraging the CAP_NET_RAW capability to change a
   socket version, related to the packet_set_ring and packet_setsockopt
   functions (CVE-2016-8655)
 * An issue was discovered in the size of the stack guard page on Linux,
   specifically a 4k stack guard page is not sufficiently large and can be
   "jumped" over (the stack guard page is bypassed), this affects Linux Kernel
   versions 4.11.5 and earlier (the stackguard page was introduced in 2010)
   (CVE-2017-1000364)
 * The arch_pick_mmap_layout function in arch/x86/mm/mmap.c in the Linux
   kernel through 4.5.2 does not properly randomize the legacy base address,
   which makes it easier for local users to defeat the intended restrictions
   on the ADDR_NO_RANDOMIZE flag, and bypass the ASLR protection mechanism for
   a setuid or setgid program, by disabling stack-consumption resource limits
   (CVE-2016-3672)
 * arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9 mismanages the #BP and
   #OF exceptions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service
   (guest OS crash) by declining to handle an exception thrown by an L2 guest
   (CVE-2016-9588)
 * The NFSv2/NFSv3 server in the nfsd subsystem in the Linux kernel through
   4.10.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash)
   via a long RPC reply, related to net/sunrpc/svc.c, fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c, and
   fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c (CVE-2017-7645)
 * The packet_set_ring function in net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel
   through 4.10.6 does not properly validate certain block-size data, which
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer signedness error
   and out-of-bounds write), or gain privileges (if the CAP_NET_RAW capability
   is held), via crafted system calls (CVE-2017-7308)
 * drivers/net/usb/catc.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.11 interacts
   incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly
   have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual
   page for a DMA scatterlist (CVE-2017-8070)
 * drivers/char/virtio_console.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before
   4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which
   allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory
   corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of
   more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist (CVE-2017-8067)
 * The mm subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.10.10 does not properly
   enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism, which allows local
   users to read or write to kernel memory locations in the first megabyte
   (and bypass slab-allocation access restrictions) via an application that
   opens the /dev/mem file, related to arch/x86/mm/init.c and
   drivers/char/mem.c (CVE-2017-7889)
 * Incorrect error handling in the set_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in
   mm/mempolicy.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.9 allows local users to
   obtain sensitive information from uninitialized stack data by triggering
   failure of a certain bitmap operation (CVE-2017-7616)
 * The vmw_surface_define_ioctl function in
   drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.6
   does not validate addition of certain levels data, which allows local users
   to trigger an integer overflow and out-of-bounds write, and cause a denial
   of service (system hang or crash) or possibly gain privileges, via a
   crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device (CVE-2017-7294)
 * The vmw_surface_define_ioctl function in
   drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.5
   does not check for a zero value of certain levels data, which allows local
   users to cause a denial of service (ZERO_SIZE_PTR dereference, and GPF and
   possibly panic) via a crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device
   (CVE-2017-7261)
 * The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does
   not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which
   allows local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection
   mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget
   and shmat system calls in a privileged context (CVE-2017-5669)
 * The hashbin_delete function in net/irda/irqueue.c in the Linux kernel
   before 4.9.13 improperly manages lock dropping, which allows local users to
   cause a denial of service (deadlock) via crafted operations on IrDA devices
   (CVE-2017-6348)
 * Double free vulnerability in the sg_common_write function in
   drivers/scsi/sg.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 allows local users to gain
   privileges or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system
   crash) by detaching a device during an SG_IO ioctl call (CVE-2015-8962)
 * drivers/vfio/pci/vfio_pci.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 allows local
   users to bypass integer overflow checks, and cause a denial of service
   (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact, by leveraging access
   to a vfio PCI device file for a VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IRQS ioctl call, aka a
   "state machine confusion bug." (CVE-2016-9083)
 * The cp_report_fixup function in drivers/hid/hid-cypress.c in the Linux
   kernel 4.x before 4.9.4 allows physically proximate attackers to cause a
   denial of service (integer underflow) or possibly have unspecified other
   impact via a crafted HID report (CVE-2017-7273)
 * The sg implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.9 does not properly
   restrict write operations in situations where the KERNEL_DS option is set,
   which allows local users to read or write to arbitrary kernel memory
   locations or cause a denial of service (use-after-free) by leveraging
   access to a /dev/sg device, related to block/bsg.c and drivers/scsi/sg.c.
   NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for
   CVE-2016-9576 (CVE-2016-10088)
 * Race condition in the get_task_ioprio function in block/ioprio.c in the
   Linux kernel before 4.6.6 allows local users to gain privileges or cause a
   denial of service (use-after-free) via a crafted ioprio_get system call
   (CVE-2016-7911)
 * The ext4_fill_super function in fs/ext4/super.c in the Linux kernel through
   4.9.8 does not properly validate meta block groups, which allows physically
   proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
   system crash) via a crafted ext4 image (CVE-2016-10208)
