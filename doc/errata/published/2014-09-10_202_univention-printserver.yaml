    * Assigning a Windows printer driver to a Samba print share renamed the
      share to the name of the printer driver which may be confusing and could
      trigger a Windows error message (code 0x0000007a). Test page printing
      would fail in this case. Now the UCS management tools create Samba
      printer shares with the option "force printername" which is provided by
      Samba as a workaround for this issue. The option get's set while
      creating new or modifying existing printer shares. The new default
      can be reverted by settings the UCR variable samba/force_printername to
      no or false. The following command can be run once on each UCS print
      server to set the option for all print shares hosted locally:
