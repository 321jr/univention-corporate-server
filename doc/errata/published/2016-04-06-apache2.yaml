src: apache2
fix: 2.2.22-13.95.201603212007
version: [0,1]
desc: |
 The following issues have been fixed in apache2:
  * HTTP request smuggling attack against chunked request parser, allowing
    cache poisoning or credential hijacking if an intermediary proxy is in
    use (CVE-2015-3183)
  * Don't limit default DH parameters to 1024 bits. This may cause problems
    with some Java based clients. A work-around is to configure these client
    not to use DHE key exchange but use ECDHE or RSA instead. A server-side
    work-around that limits the DH parameters to 1024 bits for all clients is
    described at http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/ssl/ssl_faq.html#javadh
  * Backport support for adding DH parameters to the SSLCertificateFile
    Custom DH parameters and an EC curve name for ephemeral keys,
    can be added to end of the first file configured using the
    SSLCertificateFile. Such parameters can be generated using the commands
    openssl dhparam and openssl ecparam. The parameters can be added as-is
    to the end of the first certificate file. Only the first file can be used
    for custom parameters, as they are applied independently of the
    authentication algorithm type. The package apache-doc provides more
    information about mod_ssl.
