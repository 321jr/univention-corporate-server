desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Systems with microprocessors utilizing speculative execution and indirect
   branch prediction may allow unauthorized disclosure of information to an
   attacker with local user access via a side-channel analysis (CVE-2017-5715)
 This update adds the infrastructure to the C compiler for using "retpoline".
 The compiler can be used to mitigate the "Spectre 2" vulnerability by
 re-compiling susceptible binaries until fixed CPUs or fixed CPU micro code
 updates are available from the CPU vendors.
note: The compiler itself is NOT vulnerable.
