desc: |
 NTP servers reachable from the internet that respond to the "monlist" query can be used
 to facilitate distributed denial of service attacks (CVE-2013-5211). This update adds the
 UCR variable "ntp/noquery" which can be set to "true" to disable most queries including
 the "monlist" function and thus mitigates this issue. The regular time service of NTP
 will continue to serve time updates independant of the value of the variable.
 After setting the variable the NTP service needs to be restarted in the "System services"
 module of the Univention Management Console or with the command "/etc/init.d/ntp restart".
 It is recommended to set this variable on UCS systems that exposes the NTP service
 to the internet.
