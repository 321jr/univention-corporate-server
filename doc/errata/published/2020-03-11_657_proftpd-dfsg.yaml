desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD: A dereference of a
   NULL pointer may occur. This pointer is returned by the OpenSSL
   sk_X509_REVOKED_value() function when encountering an empty CRL installed
   by a system administrator. The dereference occurs when validating the
   certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server
   mutual-authentication setup. (CVE-2019-19269)
 * In ProFTPD it is possible to corrupt the memory pool by interrupting the
   data transfer channel. This triggers a use-after-free in alloc_pool in
   pool.c, and possible remote code execution. (CVE-2020-9273)
