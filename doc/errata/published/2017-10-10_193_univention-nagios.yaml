fix: 10.1.1-6A~4.2.0.201710021715
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A new plugin has been added that checks the debian package status. The
   plugin is NOT registered by default on existing installations. If the
   plugin shall be used, the join script 30univention-nagios-client has to be
   re-executed or the Nagios service UNIVENTION_PACKAGE_STATUS needs to be
   added in the computer's Nagios settings in the Directory Management.
 * The nscd check has been fixed and should not incorrectly report the
   unknown program bound to nscd socket error anymore.
 * Since (samba) erratum 165 the UNIVENTION_SMBD nagios service failed.
   The service plugin has been fixed.
