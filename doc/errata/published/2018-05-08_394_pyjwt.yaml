 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The `invalid_strings` check in `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account
   for all PEM encoded public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format
   would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA
   PUBLIC KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables
   symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1
   PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from
   scratch. (CVE-2017-11424)
