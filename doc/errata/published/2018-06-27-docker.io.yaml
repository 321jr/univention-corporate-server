 This update addresses the following issue:
 * During the initial setup by Univention System Setup the package gets always
   installed inside the chroot environment. systemd is not yet used there, but
   the legacy SysV init scripts. Its stop action reports an error as the
   daemon is not running. This aborts the removal of the package, which is
   done when setting up a Base system. This has been fixed.
