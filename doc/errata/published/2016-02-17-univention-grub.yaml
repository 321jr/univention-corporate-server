fix: 9.0.1-4.130.201602171949
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 On UCS systems booting via BIOS, an error would happen if debconf
 grub-pc/install_devices contains a wrong device.
 If it contains a wrong device the GRUB installation happens but
 fails, leading to an inconsistent installation between /boot/grub and
 the GRUB directly on the disk.
 This makes the system unbootable.

 This update checks all devices in grub-pc/install_devices, removing
 invalid devices.

 Additionally a guess is made for the correct boot device which will
 be added to grub-pc/install_devices if grub-pc/install_devices is
 currently empty or there were invalid devices.

 If any changes were made, grub-install is run on all devices in
 grub-pc/install_devices.
