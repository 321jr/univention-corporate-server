desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Localization of the GRUB boot menu has been disabled. The title string gets
   translated to the preferred language of the user triggering menu generation
   process. This breaks selecting a boot kernel through the UCR variable
   'grub/default', as it doesn't work on systems using a different language.
 * Remove extra argument to `grub-mkdevicemap` as it is not needed.
 * Quote menu title to allow strings containing blanks.
 * Disable saving the selection by default as it is not supported on all file
   systems.
 * Add support to configure serial console support through the UCR variables
   'grub/terminal' and 'grub/serialcommand'. Thanks to Lutz Willek for the
   patch.
