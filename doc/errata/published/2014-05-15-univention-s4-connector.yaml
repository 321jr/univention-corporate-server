fix: 8.0.33-64.489.201407241105
version: [2]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The entryUUID of deleted objects in OpenLDAP is now saved to a
    local cache. This will prevent a recreation of deleted objects.
  * The synchronization has been changed to a diff based algorithm.
  * In some cases a removed group membership was not synchronized
    from OpenLDAP to Samba 4 in write mode.
  * Restart bind9 instead of samba4 if the ldap/master can't be
    resolved.
  * Two tools for removing rejected objects have been added:
     /usr/share/univention-s4-connector/remove_ucs_rejected.py
     /usr/share/univention-s4-connector/remove_s4_rejected.py
