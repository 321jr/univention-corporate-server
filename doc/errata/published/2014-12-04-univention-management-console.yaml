 This update addresses the following issues:
  * Allows UMC modules to set the response status when the module
    initialization fails. This is required to show the login dialog after a
    password change.
  * UMC identifies now also users without posix account as LDAP users.
  * Fixed a bug which prevented that UMC components could write into their
    logfiles.
  * Fixed handling of crashed UMC module processes.
  * Add the UMCP flavor to error information when a traceback occurs.
  * Connections to the LDAP server weren't closed after the session timeout.
    This caused a UMC server crash due to max open file limits.
