src: qemu-kvm
fix: 1.1.2+dfsg-6.29.49.201510271754
version: [7]
desc: |
 These vulnerabilities have been fixed in qemu-kvm:
 * the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network card did not sufficiently validate
   inputs in the C+ mode offload emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read
   uninitialized memory from the QEMU process's heap (CVE-2015-5165)
 * A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU handles the
   virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this flaw to mount a
   denial of service (QEMU process crash) (CVE-2015-5745)
 * infinite loop when receiving packets in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A
   privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a denial of service
   (QEMU process crash) (CVE-2015-5278)
 * heap buffer overflow flaw in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest
   user could use this flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash),
   or potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of
   the hosting QEMU process (CVE-2015-5279)
 * infinite loop issue in the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user
   could use this flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash)
   (CVE-2015-6815)
 * flaw in the IDE subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's
   WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a drive. A
   privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a denial of service
   (QEMU process crash) (CVE-2015-6855)
