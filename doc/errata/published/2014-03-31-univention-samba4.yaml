version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * This errata enables MS DFS support on Samba AD DCs by default.
    With this new setting Windows clients ask for DFS redirects
    for the sysvol share, which may improve efficient network
    usage in branch site configurations.
  * univention-samba4-backup has been added to backup the samba
    provision directory. This tool is periodically executed by
    cron (configurable via the UCR variable samba4/backup/cron).
