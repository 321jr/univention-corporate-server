desc: |-
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Reinitializing an installed app led to an unnecessary image pull.
   This fix skips this pull to increase the reinitialization speed.
 * Fixed an issue where installation of apps on remote UCS systems would not
   work when using wildcard SSL certificates.
 * Minor fix that makes it easier to change the timeout between calls for the
   appcenter listener converter
 * Fixed the logic to identify the main service container for multicontainer
   apps.
