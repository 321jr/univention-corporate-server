desc: |
    * When running AD takeover out of AD member mode its necessary to flush
      samba caches to steer clear of IDMAP issues.
    * If the spelling case of the domain name differs between AD and UCS the
      GPO check failed.
      This get's fixed now by renaming the domain specific directory in the
      sysvol share.
