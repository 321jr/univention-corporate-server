 This update addresses the following issues:
 * plugins\codec\libflac_plugin.dll allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (heap corruption and application crash) or possibly have
   unspecified other impact via a crafted FLAC file. (CVE-2017-9300)
 * Heap out-of-bound read in ParseJSS due to missing check of string length
   allows attackers to read heap uninitialized data via a crafted subtitles
   file. (CVE-2017-8312)
 * plugins\audio_filter\libmpgatofixed32_plugin.dll allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (invalid read and application crash) or possibly
   have unspecified other impact via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9301)
 * Potential heap based buffer overflow in ParseJSS due to skipping NULL
   terminator in an input string allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
   via a crafted subtitles file. (CVE-2017-8311)
 * Heap out-of-bound read in CreateHtmlSubtitle due to missing check of string
   termination allows attackers to read data beyond allocated memory and
   potentially crash the process (causing a denial of service) via a crafted
   subtitles file. (CVE-2017-8310)
 * Heap out-of-bound read in ParseJSS due to missing check of string
   termination allows attackers to read data beyond allocated memory and
   potentially crash the process via a crafted subtitles file. (CVE-2017-8313)
 * avcodec 2.2.x allows out-of-bounds heap memory write due to calling
   memcpy() with a wrong size, leading to a denial of service (application
   crash) or possibly code execution. (CVE-2017-10699)
