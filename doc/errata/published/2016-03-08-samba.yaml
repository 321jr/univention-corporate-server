 This update addresses the following security related issues:

   e.g. via samba-tool domain passwordsettings, the badPwdCount increased
   in steps of two for each failed login attempt at a windows client.
 * Getting and setting Windows ACLs on symlinks could change permissions
   on the link target (CVE-2015-7560)
 * The patch for CVE-2015-5252 caused a regression for the special share
   path "/".
