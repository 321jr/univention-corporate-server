    update have been clarified.

    univention-add-app --list
  - Delay requested reboot after all updates have been performed.
  - Adapted the link to the new errata overview page inside the updater module.
  - Open the Software Update UMC module upon UMC startup during release updates
    and show a information dialog about the current update process.
