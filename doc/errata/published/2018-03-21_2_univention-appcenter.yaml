  This update addresses the following issue(s):
  * The development tools did not prepend http:// to the call for "zsyncmake".
    This caused problems and has been fixed.
  * While updating from UCS 4.2 to UCS 4.3, some Apps changed their version.
    This requires a re-registration of the Apps.
  * Calling univention-upgrade noninteractively may have caused an error while
    upgrading Apps when run on a DC Master.
