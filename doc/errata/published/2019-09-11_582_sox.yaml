desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Divide by zero in startread function in wav.c (CVE-2017-11332)
 * Invalid memory read in read_samples function in hcom.c (CVE-2017-11358)
 * Divide by zero in wavwritehdr function in wav.c (CVE-2017-11359)
 * There is a heap-based buffer overflow in the ImaExpandS function of
   ima_rw.c. A Crafted input will lead to a denial of service attack during
   conversion of an audio file. (CVE-2017-15370)
 * Reachable assertion abort in the function sox_append_comment()
   (CVE-2017-15371)
 * There is a stack-based buffer overflow in the lsx_ms_adpcm_block_expand_i
   function of adpcm.c. A Crafted input will lead to a denial of service
   attack during conversion of an audio file. (CVE-2017-15372)
 * In lsx_aiffstartread in aiff.c, there is a Use-After-Free vulnerability
   triggered by supplying a malformed AIFF file. (CVE-2017-15642)
 * In the startread function in xa.c a corrupt header specifying zero channels
   triggers an infinite loop with a resultant NULL pointer dereference, which
   may allow a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service. (CVE-2017-18189)
 * Integer overflow in function lsx_make_lpf in effect_i_dsp.c (CVE-2019-8354)
 * Integer overflow in xmalloc.h (CVE-2019-8355)
 * Stack-based buffer overflow in bitrv2 in fft4g.c (CVE-2019-8356)
 * null pointer dereference in function lsx_make_lpf in effect_i_dsp.c
   (CVE-2019-8357)
 * Out-of-bounds read in function read_samples at xa.c:219 results in a denial
   of service when he victim opens a specially crafted .xa file.
