fix: 8.1.66-42.883.201505061803
version: [1]
desc: |
  This errata update addresses the following issues:
  * Cleanup scripts will now be executed if setup-join.sh is called from the
    command line. All output is logged to stdout/stderr.
  * The setup script 05_role/10role has been speeded up. It creates hard-links
    instead of copying packages into the dpkg cache.
  * Improved logging when running setup-join: run-parts now prints filenames.
  * Requests for page refresh could eventually occur on systems with an initial
    system time in the past. These requests are now disabled during the setup
    join process.
