  This erratum update fixes several issues:
  * A VNC connection initiated from Univention Virtual Machine Manager
    can now be used immediately after the start of the virtual machine.
  * The automatic check script now restarts UVMMd in case the daemon is
    no longer responding to the cyclic liveness check.
