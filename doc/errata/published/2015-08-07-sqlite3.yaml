fix: 3.7.13-1~bpo60+1.25.201507071158
desc: |
 The sqlite3VXPrintf function in printf.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not
 properly handle precision and width values during floating-point conversions,
 which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
 (integer overflow and stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via large integers in a crafted printf function call
 in a SELECT statement.
