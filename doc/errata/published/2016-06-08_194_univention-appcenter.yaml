 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * When Docker Apps were updated, a new version of the shipped join script was
   not recognized. This has been fixed, the join script is now correctly
   installed and executed.
 * The button on the App page which read "Open module" or "Open Website" has
   been relabeled to just "Open".
 * One could not uninstall Apps that other Apps required to be installed
   somewhere in the domain, even if this App was installed several times. This
   has been fixed.
