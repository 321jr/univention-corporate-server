   (CVE-2018-14682)
 * In mspack/cab.h in libmspack before 0.8alpha and cabextract before 1.8, the

   leading to an out-of-bounds write. (CVE-2018-18584)
 * chmd_read_headers in mspack/chmd.c in libmspack before 0.8alpha accepts a
   filename that has '\0' as its first or second character (such as the "/\0"
