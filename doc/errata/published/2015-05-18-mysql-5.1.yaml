fix: 5.1.73-1.42.201505131230
desc: |
 Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed in mysql-5.1:
 * Insecure creation of the debian.cnf credential file. Credentials could
   be stolen by a local user monitoring that file while the package gets
   installed. (CVE-2013-2162)
 * Buffer overrun in the MySQL client when the server sends a version
   string that is too big for the allocated buffer (CVE-2014-0001)
 * Insecure handling of a temporary file that could lead to arbitrary
   execution of code through the creation of a mysql configuration file
   pointing to an attacker-controlled plugin_dir. (CVE-2014-4274)
