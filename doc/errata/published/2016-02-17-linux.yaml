desc: |
 These vulnerabilities have been fixed:
 * ipv6: addrconf: validate new MTU before applying it (CVE-2015-0272)
   [Original reference is incorrect; should be CVE-2015-8215.]
 * virtio-net: drop NETIF_F_FRAGLIST (CVE-2015-5156)
 * vhost: actually track log eventfd file (CVE-2015-6252)
 * RDS: verify the underlying transport exists before creating a connection
   (CVE-2015-6937)
 * USB: whiteheat: fix potential null-deref at probe (CVE-2015-5257)
 * ipc/sem.c: fully initialize sem_array before making it visible
 * ipc: Initialize msg/shm IPC objects before doing ipc_addid()
   (CVE-2015-7613)
 * vfs: Fix possible escape from mount namespace or chroot (CVE-2015-2925):
   - dcache: Handle escaped paths in prepend_path
   - vfs: Test for and handle paths that are unreachable from their mnt_root
 * KEYS: Fix crash when attempt to garbage collect an uninstantiated keyring
   (CVE-2015-7872)
 * usbvision: fix overflow of interfaces array (CVE-2015-7833)
 * RDS: fix race condition when sending a message on unbound socket
   (CVE-2015-7990)
 * [x86] KVM: Intercept #AC to avoid guest->host denial-of-service
   (CVE-2015-5307)
 * CVE-2013-7446
   Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a particular sequence of valid
   operations on local (AF_UNIX) sockets can result in a
   use-after-free. This may be used to cause a denial of service
   (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
 * CVE-2015-7799
   It was discovered that a user granted access to /dev/ppp can cause a
   denial of service (crash) by passing invalid parameters to the
   PPPIOCSMAXCID ioctl. This also applies to ISDN PPP device nodes.
 * CVE-2015-8104
   Jan Beulich reported a guest to host denial-of-service flaw
   affecting the KVM hypervisor running on AMD processors. A malicious
   guest can trigger an infinite stream of "debug" (#DB) exceptions
   causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the
   core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the
   host kernel.
 * CVE-2015-8374
   It was discovered that Btrfs did not correctly implement truncation
   of compressed inline extents. This could lead to an information
   leak, if a file is truncated and later made readable by other users.
   Additionally, it could cause data loss.
 * CVE-2015-8543
   It was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets
   could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol
   number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP_NET_RAW
   capability in their user namespace.
 * CVE-2015-7513
   It was discovered that a local user permitted to use the x86 KVM
   subsystem could configure the PIT emulation to cause a denial of
   service (crash).
 * CVE-2015-7550
   Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the keyring subsystem
   that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (crash).
 * CVE-2015-8543
   It was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets
   could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol
   number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP_NET_RAW
   capability.
 * CVE-2015-8550
   Felix Wilhelm of ERNW discovered that the Xen PV backend drivers
   may read critical data from shared memory multiple times. This
   flaw can be used by a guest kernel to cause a denial of service
   (crash) on the host, or possibly for privilege escalation.
 * CVE-2015-8551 / CVE-2015-8552
   Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk of Oracle discovered that the Xen PCI
   backend driver does not adequately validate the device state when
   a guest configures MSIs. This flaw can be used by a guest kernel
   to cause a denial of service (crash or disk space exhaustion) on
   the host.
 * CVE-2015-8569
   Dmitry Vyukov discovered a flaw in the PPTP sockets implementation
   that leads to an information leak to local users.
 * CVE-2015-8575
   David Miller discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth SCO sockets
   implementation that leads to an information leak to local users.
