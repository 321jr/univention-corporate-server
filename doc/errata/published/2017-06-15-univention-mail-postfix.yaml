fix: 11.0.1-8A~4.2.0.201706131359
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Support for forwarding user emails to external addresses has been
   added. During the update, the UCR variables
   mail/postfix/virtual/alias/maps and
   mail/postfix/virtual/mailbox/maps are updated automatically,
   because some postfix virtual lookup tables have been modified.
   Please note, that the forwarding of emails on systems with OX App Suite
   will only come into effect if at least version 7.8.3-ucs2 of OX App
   Suite is installed (Bug #42249).
 * The default of the UCR variable mail/postfix/tls/client/level when
   unset has been changed to "may". On existing UCS installations this
   has already been set explicitly (Bug #44589).
 * When a relay host with authentication is used (mail/relayauth=yes),
   the Postfix option smtp_tls_security_level will automatically be set
   to "encrypt", unless mail/postfix/tls/client/level is set to "none"
   (Bug #44589).
