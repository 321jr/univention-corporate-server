fix: 1.0.1-2.54.201512151517
version: [4]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An error in the dovecot listener could lead to the unintended
   deletion of a shared folder if the corresponding LDAP objects is changed
   (Bug 40018).
 * The UMC permissions "write" and "all" for shared folders did not
   contain the IMAP permission for expunge. A removal of mails or moving
   mails was not possible. This problem has been fixed and the permission
   will be updated automatically if the join script of
   univention-mail-dovecot is called (Bug 40037).
 * A problem regarding IMAP ACLs at shared folders with primary mail address
   has been fixed. ACLs that have been removed via Univention Management
   Console or CLI have not been removed on the IMAP server (Bug 40195).
