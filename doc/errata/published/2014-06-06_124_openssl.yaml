fix: 0.9.8o-4.76.201406060850
desc: |
 This update fixes multiple security issues in OpenSSL:
 * ECSDA nonces can be retrieved through side channel attacks on cache
   timings
 * A buffer overflow in processing DTLS fragments could lead to the
   execution of arbitrary code or denial of service
 * The processing of DTLS hello packets is susceptible to denial of
   service
 * Carefully crafted handshakes can force the use of weak keys,
   resulting in potential man-in-the-middle attacks. This requires a
   vulnerable TLS client and TLS server. The OpenSSL release used in
   UCS 3.2 is not only affected when acting as a TLS client.
 * The implementation of anonymous ECDH ciphersuites is susceptible
   to denial of service
