desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The runsv service for the DHCP server is now always started, even when the
   initial check of the configuration file /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf fails. This
   sometimes happens when BIND and OpenLDAP start too slowly during boot, in
   which case that is mis-detected as an error in that configuration file.
