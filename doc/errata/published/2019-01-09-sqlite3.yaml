 This update addresses the following issue:
 * SQLite encounters an integer overflow (and resultant buffer overflow) for
   FTS3 queries that occur after crafted changes to FTS3 shadow tables,
   allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the
   ability to run arbitrary SQL statements (such as in certain WebSQL use
   cases), aka Magellan. (CVE-2018-20346)
