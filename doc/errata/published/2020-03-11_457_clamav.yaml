desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * A vulnerability in the email parsing module Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)
   Software versions 0.102.0, 0.101.4 and prior could allow an
   unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on
   an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient MIME parsing
   routines that result in extremely long scan times of specially formatted
   email files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
   crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the
   attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to scan the crafted email
   file indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service condition.
