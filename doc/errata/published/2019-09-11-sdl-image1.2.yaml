 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
   rendering functionality. A specially crafted XCF image can cause a heap
   overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a specially
   crafted image to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2018-3977)
 * An exploitable heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when loading
   a PCX file. A missing error handler can lead to a buffer overflow and
   potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image
   file to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2019-5051)
 * An exploitable integer overflow vulnerability exists when loading a PCX
   file. A specially crafted file can cause an integer overflow, resulting in
   too little memory being allocated, which can lead to a buffer overflow and
   potential code execution. An attacker can provide a specially crafted image
   file to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2019-5052)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the PCX
   image-rendering functionality. A specially crafted PCX image can cause a
   heap overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a
   specially crafted image to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2019-5057)
 * An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XCF image
   rendering functionality. A specially crafted XCF image can cause a heap
   overflow, resulting in code execution. An attacker can display a specially
   crafted image to trigger this vulnerability. (CVE-2019-5058)
 * Heap-based buffer over-read in Blit1to4 in video/SDL_blit_1.c
   (CVE-2019-7635)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in function SDL2_image function IMG_LoadPCX_RW
   in IMG_pcx.c (CVE-2019-12216)
 * null-pointer dereference in function stdio_read in file/SDL_rwops.c
   (CVE-2019-12217)
 * null-pointer dereference in function IMG_LoadPCX_RW in IMG_pcx.c
   (CVE-2019-12218)
 * Invalid free error in function SDL_SetError_REAL (CVE-2019-12219)
 * Out-of-bounds read in function SDL_FreePalette_REAL in video/SDL_pixels.c
   (CVE-2019-12220)
 * null-pointer dereference in function SDL_free_REAL in stdlib/SDL_malloc.c
   (CVE-2019-12221)
 * Out-of-bounds read in function SDL_InvalidateMap in video/SDL_pixels.c
   (CVE-2019-12222)
