desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * A nagios check for the LDAP database maximum size has been added.
   With the LDAP mdb database backend, a maximum size is configured
   for the database (ucrv ldap/database/mdb/maxsize). If the
   maximum size is reached, write requests are no longer possible.
   The new pluging checks the effective size of the database and
   returns a warning if 75%, or critical if 90% are in use.
   The plugin is activated for all DC's upon the installation of
   the nagios packages.
   For updates, the plugin has to be activated manually. This can
   be done by executing the following commands on the nagios server
   and the client.
   -> univention-run-join-scripts --force  --run-scripts \
