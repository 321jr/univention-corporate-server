version: [0]
desc: |
  * Adjusted the styling of the notification if JavaScript is disabled.
  * A warning is displayed when using Internet Explorer in version <= 8
    along with a list of all supported browsers.
  * A exception was logged in the JavaScript console when the grid was resized
    and when notifications got hidden. This was disturbing and has therefore
    been removed.
  * The JavaScript method umc.tools.umcpProgressSubCommand did not send the
    UMCP flavor along with a request and could therefore fail due to
    insufficient permissions.
  * If an outdated browser is being used, a message will be shown in the
    login dialogue. A notification after the login will no longer show up.
  * The icon on the policy reference button is now shown.
  * Fixed a bug which prevented that UMC components could write into their
    logfiles.
  * The "Favorites" category now toggles visibilty, depending on whether
    favorite modules are chosen or not.
