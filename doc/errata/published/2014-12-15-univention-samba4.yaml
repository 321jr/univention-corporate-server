  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The default for the Samba print server architecture was 32 bit.
    Now on new installed systems the print server architecture is
    determined by the host architecture.
    Additionally the smb.conf parameter "spoolss: architecture" can
    be adjusted manually by setting the new UCR variable
    "samba/spoolss/architecture" (see man smb.conf). On updated
    systems this UCR variable is maintained to keep the old default.
  * A potential issue during Samba3 to Samba4 inplace migration.
