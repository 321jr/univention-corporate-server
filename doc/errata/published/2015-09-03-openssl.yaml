fix: 0.9.8o-4.98.102.201508201736
desc: |
 Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in OpenSSL:
 * Invalid free in DTLS (CVE-2014-8176)
 * Exploitable out-of-bounds read in X509_cmp_time (CVE-2015-1789)
 * PKCS7 crash with missing EnvelopedContent (CVE-2015-1790)
 * race condition in NewSessionTicket (CVE-2015-1791)
 * CMS verify infinite loop with unknown hash function (CVE-2015-1792)
 * The TLS protocol 1.2 and earlier, when a DHE_EXPORT ciphersuite is enabled
   on a server but not on a client, does not properly convey a DHE_EXPORT
   choice, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct cipher-
   downgrade attacks by rewriting a ClientHello with DHE replaced by
   DHE_EXPORT and then rewriting a ServerHello with DHE_EXPORT replaced by
   DHE, aka the "Logjam" issue. (CVE-2015-4000)
