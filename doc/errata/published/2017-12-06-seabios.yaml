 This update addresses the following issue:
  * This is an update for the BIOS a virtual machine in UVMM uses. On reset
    the original BIOS code was not copied back completely, which could
    result in virtual machines getting stuck after reboots. In order for 
    virtual machines to load the updated BIOS, the virtual machine has to be
    shutdown and started again. A reboot does not suffice.
