fix: 3.71+dfsg-5.1.201407281355
version: [2]
desc: |
  This update provides the older version 3.72 of syslinux, a boot loader for
  Linux. It is used by the UCS network installer.
  Due to some BIOS incompatibilities the newer syslinux from UCS-3 fails to
  boot some notebooks like the DELL E6510 either locally or via PXE. The older
  version can be installed as a replacement version if such problems occur.
  For this the packages "syslinux3" and "syslinux3-common" must be installed
  instead of "syslinx" and "syslinux-common" by using the command-line tool
  "univention-install" as the user "root" or as an Administrator through the
  UMC web interface by using the App-center module.
