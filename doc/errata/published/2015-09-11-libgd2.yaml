  Multiple security vulnerabilities were fixed in libgd2:
  * The gdImageCreateFromXpm function in gdxpm.c in libgd, as used in
    PHP 5.4.26 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a
    crafted color table in an XPM file (CVE-2014-2497).
  * Potential crash of long running service due to buffer read overflow
    in gd_gif_in.c when reading crafted GIFs (CVE-2014-9709).
