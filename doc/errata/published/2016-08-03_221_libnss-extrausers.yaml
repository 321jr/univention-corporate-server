fix: 0.6-3.13.201607201843
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The Name-Service-Switch (NSS) module "extrausers" is used to get user group
   information from LDAP. The implementation of "getgrouplist()" was not
   thread-safe, which caused (for example "libvirtd") to crash on restart.
   Proper locking has been added.
