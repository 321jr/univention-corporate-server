fix: 2:4.5.1-1.851.201701050832
desc: |
 This update fixes the following issue:
 * Samba 4.5 creates an DNS object _msdcs below the position
   CN=MicrosoftDNS,CN=System. If CN=System is still used by Bind9, the
   DRS replication will be stopped. This can only happen if Samba 4
   was installed before UCS 4.0-4 and a Samba 4 system is installed or
   rejoined.
   This update removes the created DNS object and prevented its
   recreation.
