desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * An API change introduced in erratum 217 and a UDM module move in
   erratum 236 led to UDM/UMC problems on UCS systems with an UCS
   version prior to 4.0-2 errata level 217.
   The UDM module policies/mailquota is now able to use the old and
   the new API.
