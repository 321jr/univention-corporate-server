desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A Denial of Service issue was discovered in the LIVE555 Streaming Media
   libraries. It can cause an RTSPServer crash in handleHTTPCmd_TunnelingPOST,
   when RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling is supported, via x-sessioncookie HTTP
   headers in a GET request and a POST request within the same TCP session.
   This occurs because of a call to an incorrect virtual function pointer in
   the readSocket function in GroupsockHelper.cpp. (CVE-2019-6256)
 * liblivemedia mishandles the termination of an RTSP stream after
   RTP/RTCP-over-RTSP has been set up, which could lead to a Use-After-Free
   error that causes the RTSP server to crash (Segmentation fault) or possibly
   have unspecified other impact. (CVE-2019-7314)
 * In Live555, malformed headers lead to invalid memory access in the
   parseAuthorizationHeader function. (CVE-2019-9215)
