version: [1]
desc: |
  This update fixes several issues:
  * "cache_dir null /tmp" is no longer set if caching is disabled.
  * The value of squid/redirect is now used as option for the
    "url_rewrite_program" directive.
    Special case: If squid/redirect = squidguard then
    "/usr/bin/squidGuard -c /etc/squid/squidGuard.conf" is used
    for "url_rewrite_program".
