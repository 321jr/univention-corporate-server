desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * Temporary files for noVNC token files are now created on the same partition
    to fix a problem with cross-device renaming.
  * Paused VMs are now handled more similar to running VMs, which allows, for
    exmaple, VNC to be used for paused VMs, too.
  * Ignore errors when reading UVMM profiles.
