desc: |
 This update fixes the following issues:
 * The OpenLDAP schema for NIS (nis.schema) has been altered:
   The schema definition of the attribute "shadowExpire" contains now
   a ORDERING statement.
 * A new OpenLDAP overlay module has been added: pwd_scheme_kinit. It
   allows to set the userPassword attribute to {KINIT} which redirects
   the authentication to a kerberos server.
