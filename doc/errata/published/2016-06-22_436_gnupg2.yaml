 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Denial of service through malformed packets (CVE-2014-4617)
 * Infinite recursion in the compressed packet (CVE-2013-4402)
 * GnuPG  treats no-usage-permitted keys as all-usages-permitted,
   which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended cryptographic
   protection mechanisms by leveraging the subkey (CVE-2013-4351)
