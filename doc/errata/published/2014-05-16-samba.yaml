  This update fixes the following issues:
  * Add a new parameter "acl xattr update mtime" for use in smb.conf share
    sections. This will be used for the sysvol share to make rsync recognize
    permission changes on directories.
  * An error in the internal conversation of the attribute 'userParameters'
    has been fixed. This error could lead to a blocked samba process.
  * DNS updates of records with existing IPv6 addresses have been fixed.
  * Issues with the NetApp join have been fixed.
