version: [6,7]
desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * When using the mdb backend, the ldap search erroneously returned
    the base object in some cases. This has been fixed.
  * If the slapo-deref overlay is used (which is not the case in
    a standard UCS installation) and if the list of attributes
    to be dereferenced is left empty, slapd can be crashed (CVE-2015-1545)
  * Denial of service by unauthenticated remote attackers
    via crafted BER data (CVE-2015-6908)
