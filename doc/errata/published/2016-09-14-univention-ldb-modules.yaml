 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The slave PDC join script now updates some descriptions for the default
   users and groups. This avoids rejects if the Univention S4 Connector is 
   not installed on the DC master in a distributed UCS@school environment.
 * The slave PDC host account is now demoted from the central Samba in a 
   distributed UCS@school environment.
 * The school OU was not defined while joining a new Windows client. This
   issue has been fixed.
