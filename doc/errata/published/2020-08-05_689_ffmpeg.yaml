desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * In FFmpeg 4.1.3, there is a division by zero at adx_write_trailer in
   libavformat/rawenc.c. (CVE-2019-13390)
 * FFmpeg before 4.2 has a heap-based buffer overflow in vqa_decode_chunk
   because of an out-of-array access in vqa_decode_init in
   libavcodec/vqavideo.c. (CVE-2019-17542)
 * FFmpeg 4.2.3 has a use-after-free via a crafted EXTINF duration in an m3u8
   file because parse_playlist in libavformat/hls.c frees a pointer, and later
   that pointer is accessed in av_probe_input_format3 in libavformat/format.c.
