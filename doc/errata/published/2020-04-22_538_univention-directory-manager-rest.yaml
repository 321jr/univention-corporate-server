desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * After an automatic password rotation, configurable via UCR
   variable `server/password/interval`, the UDM REST API refused to deliver
   an `openapi.json` file and disallows further logins.
 * Internal change: the UCR templates of univention-directory-manager-rest
   are now python3-compatible.
