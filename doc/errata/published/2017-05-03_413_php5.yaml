 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Stack-based buffer overflow in ext/phar/tar.c (CVE-2016-2554)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact due to use-after-free
   vulnerability in wddx.c in the WDDX extension (CVE-2016-3141)
 * Denial of service or information leak in phar_parse_zipfile
   (CVE-2016-3142)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via crafted tar, zip or phar
   archive (CVE-2016-4342)
 * Untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable might allow
   remote attackers to redirect an applications outbound HTTP traffic to an
   arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request,
   aka an "httpoxy" issue (CVE-2016-5385)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data
   that leads to a __destruct call or magic method call (CVE-2016-7124)
 * Information leak: The exif_process_IFD_in_TIFF mishandles the case of a
   thumbnail offset that exceeds the file size, which allows remote attackers
   to obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted TIFF
   image (CVE-2016-7128)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via invalid ISO 8601 time
   value (CVE-2016-7129)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via an invalid base64
   binary value (CVE-2016-7130)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via a malformed wddxPacket
   XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call (CVE-2016-7131)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via invalid wddxPacket XML
   document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call (CVE-2016-7132)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via an unserialize call that
   references a partially constructed object (CVE-2016-7411)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via crafted field metadata
   (CVE-2016-7412)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via wddxPacket XML document
   that lacks an end-tag for a recordset field element (CVE-2016-7413)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via crafted PHAR archive
   (CVE-2016-7414)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via
   MessageFormatter::formatMessage call with a long first argument
   (CVE-2016-7416)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data
   (CVE-2016-7417)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact via incorrect boolean
   element in a wddxPacket XML document (CVE-2016-7418)
 * Denial of service via crafted serialized data in a wddxPacket XML document
   (CVE-2016-9934)
 * Denial of service or unspecified other impact in php_wddx_push_element
   via empty boolean element in a wddxPacket XML document (CVE-2016-9935)
 * Denial of service via crafted EXIF data in exif_convert_any_to_int
   (CVE-2016-10158)
 * Denial of service via a truncated manifest entry in a PHAR archive
   (CVE-2016-10159)
 * Denial of service or arbitrary code execution via a crafted PHAR archive
   with an alias mismatch (CVE-2016-10160)
 * Denial of service via crafted serialized data that is mishandled in a
   finish_nested_data call (CVE-2016-10161)
 * Zend/zend_exceptions.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (infinite loop) via a crafted Exception object in serialized data,
   a related issue to CVE-2015-8876. (CVE-2016-7478)
 * Potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen hostname argument
   with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port
   syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use the port number that is specified
   in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second
   argument of the function. (CVE-2017-7272)
