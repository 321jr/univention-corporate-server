fix: 2:4.10.1-1A~4.4.0.201906111641
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A user with read access to the directory can cause a NULL pointer
   dereference using the paged search control (CVE-2019-12436).
 * An authenticated user can crash the Samba AD DC's RPC server process via
   a NULL pointer de-reference. This does not affect UCS, because UCS uses
   bind9 as DNS server instead of the Samba builtin implementation
   (CVE-2019-12435).
