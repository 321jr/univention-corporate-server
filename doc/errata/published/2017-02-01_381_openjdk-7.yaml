desc: |
 Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the implementation
 of the Java platform. In Univention Corporate Server OpenJDK is
 used instead of Oracle Java. This erratum updates OpenJDK to the
 released based on the Oracle update 7u121.
 * A protected field can be leveraged into type confusion (CVE-2017-3272)
 * Custom class constructor code can bypass the required call to super.init
   allowing for uninitialized objects to be     created (CVE-2017-3289)
 * RMI deserialization should limit the types deserialized to prevent
   attacks that could escape the sandbox (CVE-2017-3241)
 * It is possible to corrupt memory by calling dispose() on a
   CMenuComponentmultiple times (CVE-2017-3260)
 * ECDSA will accept signatures that have various extraneous bytes added
   to them whereas the signature is supposed to be unique (CVE-2016-5546)
 * The PNG specification allows the [iz}Txt sections to be 2^32-1 bytes
   long so these should not be uncompressed unless the user explicitly
   requests it (CVE-2017-3253)
 * DSA signing exhibits a timing bias that mayi leak information about k
   (CVE-2016-5548)
 * ECDSA signing exhibits a timing bias that may leak information about k
   (CVE-2016-5549)
 * LdapLoginModule incorrectly tries to deserialize responses from an LDAP
   server when an LDAP context is expected (CVE-2017-3252)
 * Parsing of URLs can be inconsistent with how users or external
   applications would interpret them leading to possible security issues
   (CVE-2016-5552)
 * A value from an InputStream is read directly into the size argument of
   a new byte[] without validation (CVE-2016-5547)
 * An integer overflow exists in SocketOutputStream which can lead to
   memorydisclosure (CVE-2017-3261)
 * Under some circumstances URLClassLoader will dispatch HTTP GET requests
   where the invoker does not have permission (CVE-2017-3231)
 * 3DES can be exploited for block collisions when long running sessions
   are allowed (CVE-2016-2183)
