desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Pin the AppArmor feature set to Stretch's kernel. This ensures Stretch
   systems, even when running a newer kernel (e.g. from backports), have their
   AppArmor feature set pinned to the one supported by the AppArmor policy
   shipped in Stretch. Otherwise they would experience breakage due to new
   AppArmor mediation features introduced in recent kernels.
