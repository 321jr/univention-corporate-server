desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * There is a crash (rather than a "width or height exceeds limit" error
   report) if the image dimensions are too large, as demonstrated by use of
   the mpc coder. (CVE-2017-13144)
 * ImageMagick has an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in ReadOneMNGImage in
   coders/png.c. (CVE-2017-12640)
 * When ImageMagick processes a crafted file in convert, it can lead to an
   address access exception in the WritePTIFImage() function in coders/tiff.c.
   (CVE-2017-11640)
 * The ReadOneJNGImage function in coders/png.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (large loop and CPU consumption) via a malformed
   JNG file. (CVE-2017-11505)
 * GetNextToken in MagickCore/token.c allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG document, a
   different vulnerability than CVE-2017-10928. (CVE-2017-14682)
 * The ReadPALMImage function in palm.c allows attackers to cause a denial of
   service (memory leak) via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9407)
 * The ReadICONImage function in icon.c:452 allows attackers to cause a denial
   of service (memory leak) via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9405)
 * The ReadMPCImage function in mpc.c allows attackers to cause a denial of
   service (memory leak) via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9409)
 * The ReadOneMNGImage function in coders/png.c has an out-of-bounds read with
   the MNG CLIP chunk. (CVE-2017-13139)
 * The ReadOneDJVUImage function in coders/djvu.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a
   malformed DJVU image. (CVE-2017-11478)
 * A use-after-free in RenderFreetype in MagickCore/annotate.c allows
   attackers to crash the application via a crafted font file, because the
   FT_Done_Glyph function (from FreeType 2) is called at an incorrect place in
   the ImageMagick code. (CVE-2017-14989)
 * The WriteTHUMBNAILImage function in coders/thumbnail.c allows an attacker
   to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) by sending a crafted JPEG
   file. (CVE-2017-13769)
 * A memory leak was found in the function ReadPSDChannel in coders/psd.c,
   which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-9440)
 * The ReadEPTImage function in coders/ept.c allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-11530)
 * The ReadRLEImage function in coders\rle.c has a large loop vulnerability
   via a crafted rle file that triggers a huge number_pixels value.
   (CVE-2017-11360)
 * A memory leak was found in the function ReadPDBImage in coders/pdb.c, which
   allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-9439)
 * A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the function ReadWMFImage in
   coders/wmf.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service.
   (CVE-2017-12431)
 * An assertion failure was found in the function LockSemaphoreInfo, which
   allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-9501)
 * There is a heap-based buffer overflow in the TracePoint() function in
   MagickCore/draw.c. (CVE-2017-13758)
 * A heap-based buffer over-read in the GetNextToken function in token.c
   allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG document that
   is mishandled in the GetUserSpaceCoordinateValue function in coders/svg.c.
   (CVE-2017-10928)
 * The ReadSCREENSHOTImage function in coders/screenshot.c has memory leaks,
   causing denial of service. (CVE-2017-11447)
 * coders/mpc.c does not enable seekable streams and thus cannot validate blob
   sizes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an image
   received from stdin. (CVE-2017-11449)
 * ReadGIFImage in coders/gif.c leaves the palette uninitialized when
   processing a GIF file that has neither a global nor local palette. If the
   affected product is used as a library loaded into a process that operates
   on interesting data, this data sometimes can be leaked via the
   uninitialized palette. (CVE-2017-15277)
 * The ReadDPXImage function in coders\dpx.c has a large loop vulnerability
   that can cause CPU exhaustion via a crafted DPX file, related to lack of an
   EOF check. (CVE-2017-11188)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in the ReadSFWImage function in coders/sfw.c
   allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
   possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-12983)
 * The ReadDPXImage function in coders/dpx.c allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-11527)
 * The ReadOneMNGImage function in coders/png.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (large loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted
   file. (CVE-2017-11526)
 * The ReadCINImage function in coders/cin.c allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-11525)
 * The WriteBlob function in MagickCore/blob.c allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a
   crafted file. (CVE-2017-11524)
 * The ReadMATImage function in coders/mat.c allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-11529)
 * The ReadDIBImage function in coders/dib.c allows remote attackers to cause
   a denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-11528)
 * A crafted RLE image can trigger a crash because of incorrect EOF handling
   in coders/rle.c. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
   fix for CVE-2017-9144. (CVE-2017-11352)
 * The ReadJPEGImage function in coders/jpeg.c allows remote attackers to
   obtain sensitive information from uninitialized memory locations via a
   crafted file. (CVE-2017-11448)
 * A heap-based buffer overflow in WritePCXImage in coders/pcx.c allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or code execution via a crafted
   file. (CVE-2017-14224)
 * A heap-based buffer over-read was found in the function SFWScan in
   coders/sfw.c, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service via a
   crafted file. (CVE-2017-13134)
 * Use-after-free vulnerability in the DestroyImage function in image.c allows
   remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.
   (CVE-2017-12877)
 * The ReadTGAImage function in coders\tga.c has a memory leak vulnerability
   that can cause memory exhaustion via invalid colors data in the header of a
   TGA or VST file. (CVE-2017-11170)
 * The ReadMATImage function in coders\mat.c has a memory leak vulnerability
   that can cause memory exhaustion via a crafted MAT file, related to
   incorrect ordering of a SetImageExtent call. (CVE-2017-11141)
 * coders/jpeg.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via JPEG data
   that is too short. (CVE-2017-11450)
 * The ReadWPGImage function in coders/wpg.c does not properly validate the
   colormap index in a WPG palette, which allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (use of uninitialized data or invalid memory allocation)
   or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed WPG file.
   (CVE-2017-16546)
 * An out of bounds read flaw related to ReadTIFFImage has been reported in
   coders/tiff.c. An attacker could possibly exploit this flaw to disclose
   potentially sensitive memory or cause an application crash.
   (CVE-2017-14607)
 * The ReadJNGImage function in coders/png.c allows attackers to cause a
   denial of service (memory leak) via a crafted file. (CVE-2017-9262)
