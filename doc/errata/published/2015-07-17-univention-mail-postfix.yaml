version: [2]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * Add options to check IP-FQDN-mapping as a means to fight spam. Adds two
   new UCR variables:
   mail/postfix/smtpd/restrictions/sender/reject_unknown_client_hostname and
 mail/postfix/smtpd/restrictions/sender/reject_unknown_reverse_client_hostname
   for weaker and stricter reverse DNS checking respectively.
 * To configure the max. number of concurrent Amavis processes, a new UCR
   variable is introduced: mail/antivir/max_servers. When unset, the
   current default "2" is used.
