desc: |-
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * Docker image verification was removed from the App Center code. Instead,
    we rely on the functions of Docker itself.
  * The App Center waits for a dpkg lock before attempting to install database
    software packages. If starting the database service fails anyway, we now
    send more verbose information.
  * The package univention-appcenter is now built with dh_python2.
  * The App Center is now prepared to show app suggestions based on already
    installed apps.
  * A visual flickering in the App Center overview has been removed.
