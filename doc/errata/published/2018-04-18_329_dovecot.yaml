fix: 1:2.2.13-12~deb8u4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * An abort of SASL authentication results in a memory leak in dovecot's auth
   client used by login processes. The leak has impact in high performance
   configuration where same login processes are reused and can cause the
   process to crash due to memory exhaustion. (CVE-2017-15132)
 * A specially crafted email delivered over SMTP and passed on to Dovecot by
   MTA can trigger an out of bounds read resulting in potential sensitive
   information disclosure and denial of service. In order to trigger this
   vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted email message
   to the server. (CVE-2017-14461)
 * An attacker able to generate random SNI server names could exploit TLS SNI
   configuration lookups, leading to excessive memory usage and the process to
   restart. (CVE-2017-15130)
