fix: 9.0.0-17.239.201503231511
version: [0,1]
desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * The Univention Configuration Registry (UCR) variable descriptions for
    "mail/localmailboxsizelimit" and "mail/messagesizelimit" have been
    updated as "0" does not implement "unlimited" as previously mentioned.
  * Additional arguments for smtpd processes may now be added via UCR
    variables. The given arguments are automatically added to the config
    file /etc/postfix/master.cf. The following UCR variable prefixes are
    currently supported:
    - mail/postfix/mastercf/options/smtp/...
    - mail/postfix/mastercf/options/smtps/...
  * The first changes to the main.cf framework have been done for defining
    a custom restriction rule set via UCR variables for Postfix' smtps
    port (465). There is currently no change in Postfix behaviour.
