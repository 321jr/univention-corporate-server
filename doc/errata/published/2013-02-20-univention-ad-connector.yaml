fix: 7.0.11-3.329.201303061510
version: [0]
desc: |
  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * the daemon function could be called multiple times which results in
    an unusable status log file
  * the connector could exit if the UCR variable connector/ad/listener/dir
    points to a directory where a partition is mounted
  * the group membership synchronisation could lack in an inconsistence
    result
  * a too fast import could overwrite the changes just made to an object
    due to concurrent processes.
