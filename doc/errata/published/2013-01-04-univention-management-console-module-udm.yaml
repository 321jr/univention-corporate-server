  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * If only one LDAP object is to be (re)moved, show it in the dialog to avoid
    confusion; when right-clicking on the LDAP tree, act on the container under
    the cursor.
  * When editing an LDAP object, also recognize values that are automatically
    chosen as changes and add the option to append empty values at the end of
    an LDAP_Search-style syntax.
