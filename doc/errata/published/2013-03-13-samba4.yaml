desc: |
  This errata update fixes a security bug in the package samba4:
  * Samba 4 used a default create mask (aka create mode) of 777 for new files
    in shares other than the special sysvol and netlogon shares.
    Since Univention Corporate Server does not rely on the Samba 4 default
    create mask, it is not affected directly:
    Shares created with the Univention Management Console or with the
    Univention Directory Manager (CLI) define a more restricted create mask
    (744) by default.
