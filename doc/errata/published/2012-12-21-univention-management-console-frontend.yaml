  This errata update fixes several issues:
  * Fixed the progressbar in Basic settings not pointing to the new address if
    the IP-address was changed.
  * Fixed issues when touching the Grid's "more" button on the iPad.
  * Fixed the form not propagating values under certain circumstances (this
    broke setting the initial password in the VNC module).
  * Fixed UMCP responses which are not of mimetype json.
  * Fixed umc/widgets/MultiUploader upload button and disabling of
    umc/widgets/Uploader as well as handling of error messages.
  * Added apache rewrite rule for images to stay compatible with UMC modules
    built against UCS 3.0.
