 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The RADIUS helper program "univention-radius-ntlm-auth" now supports
   different formats for station ids, e.g. 1122.3344.5566 or
   11-22-33-44-55-66. All non-hexadecimal characters are removed
   automatically before checking the station id (Bug #42722).
