  In some environments libnss-ldap uses the DNS SRV LDAP record to look up the
  LDAP server instead of using the configured LDAP server from
  /etc/libnss-ldap.conf. This erratum added a configuration switch to
  libnss-ldap.conf to disable the DNS look up. The default is unchanged and the
  DNS lookup can be disabled by setting nssldap/nss_srv to false. This update
  also fixes an issue to prevent the override of libnss-ldap.secret in postinst if
  it is a link.
