fix: 3.8.7.1-1+deb8u4
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * CVE-2017-2518: A use-after-free bug in the query optimizer may cause a
   buffer overflow and application crash via a crafted SQL statement.
 * CVE-2017-2519: Insufficient size of the reference count on Table objects
   could lead to a denial-of-service or arbitrary code execution.
 * CVE-2017-2520: The sqlite3_value_text() interface returned a buffer that
   was not large enough to hold the complete string plus zero terminator when
   the input was a zeroblob. This could lead to arbitrary code execution or a
   denial-of-service.
 * CVE-2017-10989: SQLite mishandles undersized RTree blobs in a crafted
   database leading to a heap-based buffer over-read or possibly unspecified
   other impact.
 * CVE-2018-8740: Databases whose schema is corrupted using a CREATE TABLE AS
   statement could cause a NULL pointer dereference.
