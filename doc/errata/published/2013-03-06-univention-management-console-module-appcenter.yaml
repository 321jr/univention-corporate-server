desc: |
  This erratum fixed several issues:
  * If an application requires an extension of the LDAP schema, the
    corresponding packages are installed remotely by the local App Center. If
    the Apache web server is restarted on that remote host during the app
    installation, this does no longer lead to an error message on the local App
    Center.
  * Improved the confirmation dialog before installing an app by listing also
    packages that will be updated via automatic errata updates and all package
    changes that will be done on remote hosts.
  * If two App Center modules in the same domain have a significant different
    version and connect to each other via HTTPS, a warning is written to the
    logs.
  * The App Center now removes all default packages during the uninstallation
    even if the packages are part of the default master packages.
