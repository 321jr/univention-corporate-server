desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The retr.c:fd_read_body() function is called when processing OK responses.
   When the response is sent chunked, the chunk parser uses strtol() to read
   each chunk's length, but doesn't check that the chunk length is a
   non-negative number. The code then tries to read the chunk in pieces of
   8192 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing the negative chunk
   length to retr.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int argument, the high 32
   bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving fd_read() with a completely
   attacker controlled length argument. The attacker can corrupt malloc
   metadata after the allocated buffer. (CVE-2017-13090)
 * The http.c:skip_short_body() function is called in some circumstances, such
   as when processing redirects. When the response is sent chunked, the chunk
   parser uses strtol() to read each chunk's length, but doesn't check that
   the chunk length is a non-negative number. The code then tries to skip the
   chunk in pieces of 512 bytes by using the MIN() macro, but ends up passing
   the negative chunk length to connect.c:fd_read(). As fd_read() takes an int
   argument, the high 32 bits of the chunk length are discarded, leaving
   fd_read() with a completely attacker controlled length argument.
