desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
   * The UCR variable mail/cyrus/imap/allowplaintext to (dis)allow plain
     text passwords over non-TLS connections has been added. The variable
     defaults to "no".
     Attention: This changes the previous default behaviour! Plain text
     authentication over unencrypted connections is now disabled by
     default. To revert to the old behaviour set
     mail/cyrus/imap/allowplaintext=yes resp.
     mail/dovecot/imap/allowplaintext=yes (Bug #38500).
   * Several changes related to dovecot integration (Bug #38479, #38707)
   * The UDM module policies/mailquota has been moved to the package
     univention-mail-cyrus. The UDM module will only be available if the
     UCS mail stack with cyrus is installed. No change in behaviour
     (Bug #38473).
