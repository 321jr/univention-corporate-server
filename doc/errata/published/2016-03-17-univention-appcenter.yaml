 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * univention-register-apps now uses the new appcenter API and has been
   deprecated.
 * An error during loading the appcenter cache has been fixed which prevented
   using the appcenter when the cache file was corrupted.
 * Malformed files for meta information could cause the App Center to show a
   traceback. This has been fixed, those files are ignored now.
 * Upon upgrading the App Center software package, the App cache could get
   outdated. This caused an error in the App Center in some cases.
