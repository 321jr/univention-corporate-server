  This errata update fixes three bugs in the package univention-samba4:
  * In some cases the sysvol ownership was not yet updated correctly
    after the installation or join of univention-samba4.
  * During update of a joined master of backup the standard DNS SRV
    records for Kerberos and LDAP are checked for non-Samba4 systems
    and for port 7389. Records advertising non-Samba4 systems and
    port 7389 are removed from the SRC records.
  * Joining an UCS@school Samba4 Slave PDC was not possible in case
    any system in the UCS@school domain was still offing the service
    "Samba 3".
