  This errata addresses the following issues:
  * Five syntax classes received lookup optimizations that result in faster opening 
    of objects in the UDM frontend. This addresses performance problems in large 
    environments.
  * The actions for saving and canceling the editing of UDM objects are published 
    now for the Piwik system.
