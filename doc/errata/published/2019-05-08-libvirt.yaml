desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Since UCS-4.3 erratum 269 UVMM can be configured to check the CPU model
   before performing a live migration. Due to a bug in `libvirt` the use of
   `host-model` does not survive the creation of snapshots or suspend to disk
   and gets rewritten to the concrete CPU model of the host system. This has
   been fixed.
   Old snapshots created and domains suspended before this erratum might fail
   to start, in which case the <cpu/> configuration must be manually removed
   from the XML description using `virsh snapshot-edit` or `virsh
   save-image-edit` respectively.
