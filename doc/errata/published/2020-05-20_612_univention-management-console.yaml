desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * It is now possible to navigate to an UMC module without the overview
   of all UMC modules and have only that UMC module open.
   This can be achieved for example with:
   https://fqdn/univention/management/?overview=no#module=top
 * The Content-Security-Policy for UMC and its login dialog is now
   configurable via the umc/http/content-security-policy/.* and
   umc/login/content-security-policy/.* UCR variables.
   The X-Frame-Options default header has been replaced
   with the Content-Security-Policy frame-ancestor setting.
 * Some preparations for the upcoming "Univention Portal" app have
   been made.
 * The UMC-Server components are now Python 3 compatible.
