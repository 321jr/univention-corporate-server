  This update addresses the following issues:
  * LDAP base DNs with uppercase letters caused synchronization rejects.
  * GPO Security Descriptors can now be synchronized between OpenLDAP and
    Samba Directroy Service. By default this is not activated, an upcoming
    errata update for UCS@school 4.0 will make use of this feature.
  * Ignore cn=Subschema and warn if listener didn't pass entryUUID
