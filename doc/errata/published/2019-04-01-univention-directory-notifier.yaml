desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * Since UCS-4.3-3 erratum 427 the Univention Directory Notifier (UDN) writes
   transactions both to the file `/var/lib/univention-ldap/notify/transaction`
   and the `cn=translog` database in OpenLDAP. A failed write to the later can
   make UDN abort, in which case UDN is restarted automatically and writes the
   pending transactions to said file again. This leads to inconsistency.
   The order has been swapped to prevent this issue from happening again.
   The transaction file might require manual corrections if UDN fails to start
   up properly. Details of this procedure will be provided by a future update.
