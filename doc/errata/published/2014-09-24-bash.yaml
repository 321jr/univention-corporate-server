desc: |
 Stephane Chazelas discovered a vulnerability in bash, the GNU
 Bourne-Again Shell, related to how environment variables are
 processed. In many common configurations, this vulnerability is
 exploitable over the network, especially if bash has been configured
 as the system shell.
 Additionally there are two out-of-bounds array accesses in the bash parser,
 which were revealed in Red Hat's internal analysis for these issues and
 also independently reported by Todd Sabin:
 * Parser can allow out-of-bounds memory access while handling redir_stack
   (CVE-2014-7186)
 * Off-by-one error in deeply nested flow control constructs
   (CVE-2014-7187)
