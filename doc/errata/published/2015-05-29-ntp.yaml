fix: 1:4.2.6.p2+dfsg-1.41.201505271824
desc: |
 This update fixed the following issues:
 * Information leak/denial of service in autokey crypto handling
   (CVE-2014-9297)
 * ACLs restricting the access to control mode queries can be bypassed
   on IPv6 networks (CVE-2014-9298)
 * Man-in-the-middle attackers may spoof packets by omitting the MAC because
   the symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c requires
   a correct MAC only if the MAC field has a nonzero length (CVE-2015-1798)
 * Man-in-the-middle attackers may cause a denial of service (synchronization
   loss) by spoofing the source IP address of a peer because the symmetric-key
   feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c performs state-variable
   updates upon receiving certain invalid packets (CVE-2015-1799)
