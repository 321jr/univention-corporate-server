fix: 11.0.12-11.757.201507201215
version: [2]
desc: |
  This update addresses the following issues:
  * Adds UCR variables 'ldap/tls/ciphersuite' and 'ldap/tls/minprotocol' to
    configure the allowed ciphers and the minimum requires TLS version.
    By default 'RC4', 'NULL' and 'SSLv3' are now disabled.
  * Enables Forward Secrecy by default, which can be configured further through
    several new UCR variables starting with 'ldap/tls/dh/...'.
  * The DHCP policies are no longer linked to the LDAP base.
