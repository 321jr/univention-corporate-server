fix: 1.4.4-2.1+deb8u2
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The gst_ps_demux_parse_psm function in gst/mpegdemux/gstmpegdemux.c in
   gst-plugins-bad in GStreamer allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (invalid memory read and crash) via vectors involving PSM parsing.
   (CVE-2017-5848)
 * Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in the (1) gst_mini_object_unref,
   (2) gst_tag_list_unref, and (3) gst_mxf_demux_update_essence_tracks
   functions allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
   vectors involving stream tags, as demonstrated by 02785736.mxf.
   (CVE-2017-5843)
 * The _parse_pat function in the mpegts parser allows remote attackers to
   cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via a
   crafted file. (CVE-2016-9813)
 * The gst_mpegts_section_new function in the mpegts decoder allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a too small
   section. (CVE-2016-9812)
 * Off-by-one error in the gst_h264_parse_set_caps function allows remote
   attackers to have unspecified impact via a crafted file, which triggers an
   out-of-bounds read. (CVE-2016-9809)
