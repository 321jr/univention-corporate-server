version: [4]
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * The timeout for the initial LDAP search during domain join was increased to
   2h, as joining in a large domain can take much longer than the default 5m.
   The time can be changed through the UCR variable 'listener/timeout/scans'.
