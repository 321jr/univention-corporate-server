desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The mapping of syntax classes to UMC widgets is now extendable via the
   UCR variable group "directory/manager/web/widget/.*/".
 * In some cases ldap operations against a broken ldap connection were done
   which lead to "LDAP connection invalid" error messages. In that case the
   operation is executed again with a new ldap connection.
 * The notification for successfully creating a user or computer now appears
   inside the wizard dialog.
 * Opening a user is now faster.
 * A link to the manual section about extended attributes has been
   added in the UMC users, groups and computers modules.
