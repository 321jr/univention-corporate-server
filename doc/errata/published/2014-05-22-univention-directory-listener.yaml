fix: 8.0.1-5.229.201405261549
version: [1,2]
desc: |
  This update fixes the following issues:
  * The case of distinguished names (DN) sometime differs between different
    clients and is now ignored.
  * A rename of an LDAP object can lead to a single-values attribute becoming
    multi-valued, which breaks multiple modules, especially the synchronization
    to Samba. The listener now implements delold=1 and removes all old RDNs to
    just keep the new RDN.
