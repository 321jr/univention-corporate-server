fix: 0.9.8o-4.82.201412100736
desc: |
 These vulnerabilities have been fixed:
 * Carefully crafted handshakes can force the use of weak keys, resulting in
   potential man-in-the-middle attacks. This requires a vulnerable TLS client
   and TLS server. The OpenSSL release used in UCS 3.1 is not only affected
   when acting as a TLS client (CVE-2014-0224)
 * Fix CVE-2012-4929 (CRiME) by disabling zlib compression by default. It can
   be enabled again by setting the environment variable
   OPENSSL_NO_DEFAULT_ZLIB.
 * ECSDA nonces can be retrieved through side channel attacks on cache timings
   (CVE-2014-0076)
 * A buffer overflow in processing DTLS fragments could lead to the execution
   of arbitrary code or denial of service (CVE-2014-0195)
 * The processing of DTLS hello packets is susceptible to denial of service
   (CVE-2014-0221)
 * The implementation of anonymous ECDH ciphersuites is susceptible to denial
   of service (CVE-2014-3470)
 * Information leak in pretty printing functions (CVE-2014-3508)
 * Double Free when processing DTLS packets (CVE-2014-3505)
 * DTLS memory exhaustion (CVE-2014-3506)
 * DTLS memory leak from zero-length fragments (CVE-2014-3507)
 * OpenSSL DTLS anonymous EC(DH) denial of service (CVE-2014-3510)
