fix: 10.0.1-4A~4.3.0.201811271006
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The new UCR variable postgres9/pg_hba/config/* allows for additional
   configuration options in the pg_hba.conf file.
 * The rule for the PostgreSQL superuser has been moved to the beginning
   of `pg_hba.conf` to always grant access to that internal user. This is
   required for automatic maintenance and similar tasks.
