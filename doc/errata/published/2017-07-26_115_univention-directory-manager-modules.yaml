desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * Some spelling mistakes in the UDM CLI Client have been corrected.
 * Unused legacy code has been removed.
 * Legacy code regarding the ordering number of extended attributes has
   been cleaned up.
 * A lookup function for the users/self and users/passwd modules have been
   added for convenience.
 * The error handling during adding hosts to nagios services has been
   improved.
 * The temporary locking objects are removed when an error happens during
   object creation. This prevents that one needs to save an object
   twice to create it after resolving the error.
 * It is currently possible to supply a wrong object type when modifying
   objects. This erratum prepares for preventing this by adding more error
   messages to the logfiles instead.
 * UDM objects with the object flags synced and docker can now be deleted.
 * Passing univention.uldap.access() instances to UDM objects is handled more
   gracefully.
 * The detection of DNS TXT and Host records has been improved to not detect
   objects as the wrong type.
 * The description for the "options" property of extended attributes
   has been improved.
 * An LDAP error is prevented when changing the user password and the
   "Change password on next login" option at the same time.
 * Unused legacy code regarding container/dc objects has been removed.
 * Some undefined python references have been fixed.
 * Removing the IP range from a network object is possible again.
 * The "hosts" property has been added to the settings/umc_operationset.
 * The "description" property of settings/umc_operationset is now a
   required field.
 * It was not possible to automatically get the next free IP address for
   a newly created computer object when the license was exceeded.
 * The group members of printer groups with multiple spool hosts are now
   detected correctly again.
 * The validation when removing and modifying printers and printer groups
   has been corrected.
 * The "Spool Host" label of printers and printer groups has been renamed
   into "Print server".
 * The "e-mail" property of a user is no longer copyable.
 * Support lookup of specific attributes via PostReadControl (RFC 4527)
