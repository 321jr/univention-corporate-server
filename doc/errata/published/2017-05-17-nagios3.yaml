fix: 3.2.1-2.57.201612191626
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A stack-based buffer overflow in the cmd_submitf function in cgi/cmd.c
   in Nagios allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (segmentation fault) via a long message to cmd.cgi (CVE-2014-1878)
 * The update check has been removed (related to CVE-2016-9565)
 * base/logging.c in Nagios Core before 4.2.4 allows local users with access
   to an account in the nagios group to gain root privileges via a symlink
   attack on the log file.  NOTE: this can be leveraged by remote attackers
   using CVE-2016-9565 (CVE-2016-9566)
