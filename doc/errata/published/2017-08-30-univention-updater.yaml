desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The temporary APT sources.list used for release updates is now removed if
   any of the pre-update scripts signals an abort condition.
 * The check for QEMU virtual machines has been removed from the pre-update
   script.
 * App updates that merely update software packages inside the App's Docker
   container are not displayed anymore as these updates are currently not
   supported through the App Center module.
