  This update fixes the following issues:
  * A memory leak caused by parsing XML documents has been fixed.
  * Some unused code has been removed.
  * A display error of the icon for VNC access in Firefox has been corrected
    in the UMC module.
  * An error in the grid of the UMC module resulted in an endless refreshing
    loop of the grid if no connection was available. This has been adjusted.
  * Orphaned widget references in the UMC module that would lead to a growing
    memory consumption in the browser are now cleaned up.
  * The Debian-installer does no longer set locale/keymap, which caused the
    join script to use en-us as default keyboard layout. This has been fixed.
