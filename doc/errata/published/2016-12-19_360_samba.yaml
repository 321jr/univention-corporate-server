fix: 2:4.5.1-1.849.201612152121
desc: |
 This update fixes the following issues:
 * Overflow in Samba NDR parsing function ndr_pull_dnsp_name causes
   vulnerability to remote code execution (CVE-2016-2123).
 * Unconditional privilege delegation to Kerberos servers in trusted realms
   (CVE-2016-2125).
 * Flaws in Kerberos PAC validation can trigger privilege elevation
   (CVE-2016-2126).
 * Samba has been updated to version 4.5.3. The Debian package version
   doesn't reflect this and stays at 2:4.5.1-1.849.
 * Rejoining a DC Backup or DN Slave failed in UCS 4.1-4 because samba-tool
   domain join didn't support the option --keep existing any longer.
