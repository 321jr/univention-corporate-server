desc: |
 Two vulnerabilities were found in OpenSSH:
 * The AcceptEnv option was misparsed if it contained a wildcard (CVE-2014-2532).
 * OpenSSH offers a feature to retrieve SSH hostkeys from DNS called SSHFP (not
   enabled in UCS by default). If the clients rejected the host certificate of a
   SSHFP-enabled server, then no SSHFP record was fetched from DNS
   (CVE-2014-2653).
note: This update fixes these vulnerabilities.
