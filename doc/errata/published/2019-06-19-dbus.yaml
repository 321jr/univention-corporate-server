fix: 1.10.28-0+deb9u1
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue:
 * dbus as used in DBusServer allows cookie spoofing because of symlink
   mishandling in the reference implementation of DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 in the
   libdbus library. (This only affects the DBUS_COOKIE_SHA1 authentication
   mechanism.) A malicious client with write access to its own home directory
   could manipulate a ~/.dbus-keyrings symlink to cause a DBusServer with a
   different uid to read and write in unintended locations. In the worst case,
   this could result in the DBusServer reusing a cookie that is known to the
   malicious client, and treating that cookie as evidence that a subsequent
   client connection came from an attacker-chosen uid, allowing authentication
   bypass. (CVE-2019-12749)
