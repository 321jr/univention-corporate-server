 This update addresses the following issue:
 * bash-completion for umount allows local users to gain privileges by
   embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is mishandled during a
   umount command (within Bash) by a different user, as demonstrated by
   logging in as root and entering umount followed by a tab character for
   autocompletion. (CVE-2018-7738)
