desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
   * The UDM module policies/mailquota has been moved to the package
     univention-mail-cyrus. From now on the module will only be available
     if the UCS domain contains an UCS system with installed cyrus
     mail stack.
   * A default user template for new users can be configured by the UCR
     variable "directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/add/default". The
     variable expects the DN or the label of a user template.
