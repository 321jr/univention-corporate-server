fix: 10.0.0-14.325.201607181745
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * IPv6 support was added to "get_notifier_id.py".
 * The help messages for "univention-directory-listener-ctrl" were improved.
   Also two new subcommand 'modules' and 'status' have been added.
 * Some string and integer comparison bugs have been fixed.
 * The Listener did not drop root privileges in all error cases.
 * Some old and no longer needed code has been removed to reduce the memory
   footprint.
 * Some debug messages were cleaned up.
 * Some data structures are no longer allocated dynamically but put onto the
   stack to make the Listener more robust against memory allocation problems.
 * A bug in handling the notifier ID has been fixed: If the Listener was
   restarted multiple times, the last processed transaction ID could be lost.
   This led to all transactions being skipped which happened in between.
 * The locking has been improved to prevent multiple instances of the Listener
   running at the same time.
 * The transaction log is now only written on systems where the Notifier is
   installed as well to prevent the hard disk from filling up.
