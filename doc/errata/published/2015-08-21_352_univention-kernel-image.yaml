version: [6]
desc: |
 This erratum updates the Linux kernel in UCS 3.2 to 3.10.87. Among
 several further bugfixes, this resolves multiple security issues:
 * Xen did not properly restrict access to PCI command registers
   (CVE-2015-2150)
 * The InfiniBand (IB) implementation did not properly restrict use of
   User Verbs for registration of memory regions (CVE-2014-8159)
 * Incorrect implementation of SYSENTER emulation (CVE-2015-0239)
 * iptables doesn't handle SCTP rules unless the SCTP module is loaded
   (CVE-2014-8160)
 * ext4 denial of service (CVE-2014-7822)
 * The pipe implementation did not properly consider the side effects of
   failed in atomic calls (CVE-2015-1805)
 * The Btrfs implementation did not ensure that the visible xattr state is
   consistent with a requested replacement (CVE-2014-9710)
 * TCP Fast Open local DoS (CVE-2015-3332)
 * Privilege escalation via ping sockets due to use-after-free
   (CVE-2015-3636)
 * Linux UDP checksum DoS (CVE-2015-5364)
 * Linux UDP checksum DoS EGAIN part (CVE-2015-5366)
 * Linux mishandles int80 fork from 64-bit tasks (CVE-2015-2830)
 * Buffer overruns in Linux kernel RFC4106 implementation using AESNI
   (CVE-2015-3331)
 * Race condition in the prepare_binprm function in fs/exec.c allows local
   users to gain privileges by executing a setuid program at a time instant
   when a chown to root is in progress, and the ownership is changed but
   the setuid bit is not yet stripped (CVE-2015-3339)
note: This is the second part of the fix, which provides the meta package.
