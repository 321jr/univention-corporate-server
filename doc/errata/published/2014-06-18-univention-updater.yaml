  This update fixes several issues:
  * The local UCR variable uuid/license is now removed if the key ID is missing
    in the UCS license.
  * univention-add-app no longer registers a link on the UCS startsite and
    removes the component again if called with --master (just like the App
    Center module)
  * The component installation status is now transferred via the apt user agent.
