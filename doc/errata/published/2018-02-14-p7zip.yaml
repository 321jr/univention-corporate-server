desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * The CInArchive::ReadFileItem method in Archive/Udf/UdfIn.cpp allows remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or execute
   arbitrary code via the PartitionRef field in the Long Allocation Descriptor
   in a UDF file. (CVE-2016-2335)
 * Heap-based buffer overflow in the NCompress::NShrink::CDecoder::CodeReal
   method allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
   write) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted ZIP archive.
   (CVE-2017-17969)
 * p7zip allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a symlink
   attack in an archive. (CVE-2015-1038)
