desc: |
 This update addresses the following issue(s):
 * The UCR variable samba/idmap/range has been added
   to configure the uid and gid range for the default (*)
   idmap backend. This can be used to avoid overlaps between
   that default range and the domain specific setting, which is
   configurable via samba/idmap/$windows_domain/range.
 * The UCR variables samba/client/min/protocol, samba/min/protocol
   and samba/client/max/protocol have been added.
   Please be aware that raising samba/min/protocol e.g. to SMB2 also
   requires raising samba/client/max/protocol to that value or higher.
