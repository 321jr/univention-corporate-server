fix: 1.8.10-6+deb8u5
desc: |
 This update addresses the following issues:
 * A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion to run an
   arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a malicious
   server, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to attack
   another user of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server. The
   vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://,
   http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://. (CVE-2017-9800)
 * Subversion's mod_dontdothat module and HTTP clients are vulnerable to a
   denial-of-service attack caused by exponential XML entity expansion. The
   attack can cause the targeted process to consume an excessive amount of CPU
   resources or memory. (CVE-2016-8734)
