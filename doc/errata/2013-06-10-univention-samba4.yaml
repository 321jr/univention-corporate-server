  This errata update fixes two bugs in the package univention-samba4:
  * The ntp_signd socket directory is now created during package
    installation, so required group ownership can be set.
  * The Joinscript 98univention-samba4-dns fails if the complexity of
    the random password generated for the dns-$hostname service
    account was too low. A more suitable algorithm is use now for
    password genration in this case.
