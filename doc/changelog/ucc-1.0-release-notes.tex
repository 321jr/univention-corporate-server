\chapter{Release highlights}

With Univention Corporate Client 1.0, the first release of the
successor of Univention Corporate Desktop and UCS Thin Client Services
is now available.

\chapter{Upgrades from Univention Corporate Desktop and UCS Thin Client Services}
Since the image-based installation approach used in UCC is technically
totally different from the installation procedures used in UCD and
TCS, no direct upgrade path exists.

UCC can be installed in parallel to TCS. Existing UCD managed/mobile
and TCS thin clients need to be replaced with UCC clients.

On installations, where \ucsTCS{} is installed on the \ucsMaster{},
the thin client server needs to be migrated to
a \ucsBackup{}, \ucsSlave{} or \ucsMember{} system before an upgrade
to UCS 3.0 (and subsequently 3.1) is possible.
