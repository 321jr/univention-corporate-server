\end{itemize}

\chapter{Recommended update order for environments with more than one UCS server / Updating systems with UCS components}

In environments with more than one UCS system, the update order of the
UCS systems must be borne in mind:

The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service
is maintained on the master domain controller and replicated on all the remaining
LDAP servers of the UCS domain. As changes to the LDAP schemes can
occur during release updates (see Chapter 3.4.1 of the UCS
manual \cite{UCS-Handbuch}), the master domain controller must always be the first
system to be updated during a release update.

It is generally advisable to update all UCS systems in one maintenance
window whenever possible. 

\section{Information on environments with third-party software}

When using third-party software it should generally be clarified with
the manufacturer/reseller \emph{before} the update whether it can still
be used without restrictions with the latest version of Univention
Corporate Server. 

The manufacturers/resellers of products based on Univention Corporate
Server are responsible for the publication themselves. Updates must
thus be procured from them.

If you were provided with modified package versions by Univention,
you must check whether the update will overwrite the coordinated
packages - preferably in a test environment. If you identify any
problems here, please contact Univention.


\chapter{Preparation of update}
It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available. A
standard installation requires a minimum of 6 GB of memory. Depending
on the scope of the existing installation, the update will require at
least another 1 GB of memory for the downloading and installation of
the packages.

For the update, a login should be performed on the console with
the \emph{root} user and then the update started there. Alternatively,
the update can be initiated using the \ucsUMC{}.

Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the
update procedure being cancelled if the network connection is
interrupted, for example, and this can affect the system. If updating
should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be
verified that the update continues despite disconnection from the
network. This can be done, for example, using the
tools \ucsCommand{screen} and \ucsCommand{at}, which are installed on
all system roles.



\chapter{Postprocessing of the update}
Following the update, new or updated join scripts need to be executed.
This can be done in two ways: Either using the UMC module 
\ucsMenuEntry{Domain join} or by running the command
\ucsCommand{univention-run-join-scripts} as the user \emph{root}.

Subsequently the UCS system should be restarted.

\section{Migration to Grub 2}
Starting with UCS 3.0, in a new installation, the Univention Installer writes Grub 2 in the
boot sector directly.

In an update, Grub 1 remains installed in the master boot record
(MBR). Grub 2 sets up a ``Chainload into Grub'' entry, which then
loads the actual Grub 2.

Documentation explaining how to write Grub 2 directly in the MBR on
updated systems will be provided at a later date (\ucsBug{23544}).

\section{Migration of PostgreSQL 8.3 to PostgreSQL 8.4}
As of UCS 3.0, PostgreSQL 8.4 is also available in addition to
PostgreSQL 8.3. When systems with PostgreSQL 8.3 are updated to UCS
3.0, however, the installed PostgreSQL version is retained.

The update to PostgreSQL 8.4 is described in the SDB
article \ucsURL{http://sdb.univention.de/1220}.

\section{Updating the database schemas of the Horde web mailer}
After the update the database schemas of the Horde webmailer should be
updated in the Horde administration interface. For that a login using
a Horde administrator - i.e. a user, whose email address is specificed
in the \ucsUCR{} variable \ucsUCRVSA{horde/auth/admins} - must be
performed.

After logging in, it must be navigated to the URL
\ucsURL{http://IPADDRESS/horde4/admin/config} and the option 
\ucsMenuEntry{Update all DB schemas} needs to be selected.

\chapter{Further notes on selected packages}

\section{Collection of usage statistics when using the free-for-personal-use version}

Anonymous usage statistics on the use of the \ucsUMC{} are collected when using the \emph{free for
personal use} version of UCS (which is generally used for evaluating UCS). The modules
opened are logged in an instance of the web traffic analysis tool Piwik. This makes it
possible for Univention to tailor the development of the \ucsUMC{} better to customer needs
and carry out usability improvements.

This logging is only performed when the free-for-personal-use license
is used. The license status can be verified by clicking on the cog
symbol in the top righthand corner of the \ucsUMC{} and
selecting \ucsMenuEntry{License}. If \emph{Free for personal use
edition} is listed under \ucsMenuEntry{LDAP base}, this version is in
use. When a regular UCS license is used, no usage statistics are
collected.

Indendepent of the licence used, the statistics generation can be
deactivated by setting the \ucsUCR{} variable \ucsUCRVSA{umc/web/piwik} to \emph{false}.

\section{Bootproblems when using the UEFI installation DVD}
As of UCS 3.1, in addition to the standard installation DVD there is
also a medium with support for the Unified Extensible Firmware
Interface standard (UEFI) available for the amd64 architecture.

It can be used instead of the standard DVD on systems which only
support a UEFI boot.

\section{Scope of security support for Webkit, Konqueror und QtWebKit}
Webkit, Konqueror and QtWebkit are shipped in the maintained branch of
the UCS repository, but not covered with security support. Webkit is
primarily used for displaying HTML help pages etc. Firefox should be
used as the web browser.

\section{Recommeded browsers for the access to the Univention Management Console}

\ucsUMC{} uses numerous Javascript and CSS functions to display the
web interface. Cookies need to be permitted in the browser.
The following browsers are recommended:

\begin{itemize}
\item Chrome as of version 14
\item Firefox as of version 10
\item Internet Explorer as of version 9
\item Safari (on the iPad 2)
\end{itemize}

Users with older browsers may experience display or performance
problems. The installation of a current Firefox version on UCS 3.1 is
documented in the Univention Wiki \cite{ucd-firefox7}.

b\section{Restrictions in Samba 4 operation}

The versions of Samba 4 currently published by the Samba project are
undergoing more intensive changes in their further
development than Samba 3. For this reason, some functions are not yet
completely available:

\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Windows domain controllers cannot be joined in a Samba
4 domain currently.
\item Selective replication is not possible with Samba 4 as this is
not supported by Active Directory in principle (in UCS@school
selective replication is implemented through the listener/notifier
replication mechanism).

\item Samba 4 does not currently support forest domains. 
\item Samba 4 does not currently support trust relationships.
\end{itemize}

Further information can be found in Chapter 8 of the UCS
manual \cite{UCS-Handbuch}.

\section{Installation in VirtualBox}
During the installation of UCS in the virtualization solution VirtualBox, a bug
may appear which has been corrected in version 4.2: if UCS has been
successfully installed and the DVD is still in the disk drive, the
installation DVD offers the option \ucsMenuEntry{Boot from first
harddisk partition}. If you select this option, VirtualBox freezes. 

For Linux distributions which still use Virtualbox 4.0 or 4.1, either
the installation DVD can be taken out of the drive settings of the
VirtualBox VM or F12 pressed when starting the virtual instance and
the hard drive selected as a boot partition as a workaround before
starting the UCS VM. UCS will then start successfully.

\section{Migration of a Samba 3 environment to Samba 4}
\label{samba-migration}

There are two basic procedures for migrating Samba 3 to Samba 4:

\begin{itemize}
\item Setup of a parallel Samba 4 domain. Both domains use different
NetBIOS names and SIDs. The clients then join the Samba 4 step by
step.
\item Migration of all systems within one maintenance window.
\end{itemize}

Both procedures are documented in detail in the Univention Wiki:
\ucsURL{http://wiki.univention.de/index.php?title=Migration_from_Samba_3_to_Samba_4}.

\section{Xen} % Bug #29296
If the Xen hypervisor is used and the memory limit for the Dom0 has been configured using the \ucsUCR{}-Variable \ucsUCRVSA{grub/xenhopt}, the value should be updated to include the \texttt{,max:} part as well.
See the \href{http://wiki.univention.de/index.php?title=UVMM_Quickstart-3.1/en#Configuring_the_Dom0}{UVMM Quickstart guide} for further details.
