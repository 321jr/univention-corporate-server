%\section{General}
\begin{itemize}
\item The codename for UCS 3.2 is Borgfeld (\ucsBug{31686})

\item The welcome message is now shown through \ucsFile{/etc/issue} (\ucsBug{31094}).

\end{itemize}


\section{Univention Installer}
\begin{itemize}

\item \ucsName{univention-horde4} has been removed from the software
selection. \ucsName{Horde} is available in the UCS AppCenter
(\ucsBug{31812}). 

\item The input of non ascii characters in the installer has been disabled
(\ucsBug{24904}).

\item The \emph{Software RAID} boot entry has been renamed to \emph{expert
partitioning} (\ucsBug{24051}).

\item Some deprecated code blocks have been removed (\ucsBug{31825}).

\item The query for the windos domain name in the basic settings has been
removed for non DC master systems (\ucsBug{24442}).

\item The DHCP query button in the network settings has been removed, instead
the DHCP query is performed when dhcp is selected (\ucsBug{31174}).

\item The error message if the hostname starts with digits has been clarified
(\ucsBug{29349}).

\item The order in the language selections list has been fixed
(\ucsBug{24361}).

\item The domainname and windows domainname syntax tests in the basic settings
have been fixed (\ucsBug{24888}).

\item Directories created during the installation have their permissions set
to 0755 (\ucsBug{29450}).

\item Some problems with screen refreshes in the XenCenter UCS installation
have been fixed (\ucsBug{31051}).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Profile-based installation}
\begin{itemize}

\section{Basic system services}

%\subsection{Boot loader}
%\begin{itemize}
%\end{itemize}

\subsection{Linux kernel and firmware packages}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Linux kernel was updated to 3.10-rc7. The nouveau KMS kernel
  module is incompatible with the Xorg version in UCS 3.2 and now
  blacklisted (\ucsBug{31701}). This update also resolves occasional
  kernel traces when operating a UCS installation in Amazon EC2 (\ucsBug{30369}).

\item The kernel 2.6.32 transition packages have been removed (\ucsBug{31593}).

\item The kernel meta packages now enable the
  \ucsUCRV{update/reboot/required}, which triggers a note to the user
  that the system requires a reboot to complete the update (\ucsBug{24287}).

\item The \ucsUCRV{kernel/blacklist} can now be used to prevent kernel
  modules from being loaded. Multiple entries need to be separated
  with a semicolon. By default the nouveau module is now blacklisted
  since the kernel module from 3.10 is incompatible with the Xorg
  userland (\ucsBug{19892}).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Univention Configuration Registry}
\begin{itemize}
\item The process handling in \ucsName{univention-config-registry} has been improved to prevent issues with process
  signals during system calls (\ucsBug{31140}).

\item The Univention Config Registry layers were processed in the wrong order when using the 'search' subcommand. Now all commands consistently return the value from the layer with the highest priority, which are 'force', 'schedule', 'ldap' and 'normal' (\ucsBug{29632}).

\item UCR now writes the changes to a temporary file first and moves the file
in a second step, otherwise the file might be not completly written if UCR
tries to read a variable (\ucsBug{31725}, \ucsBug{31853}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{OpenLDAP}
\begin{itemize}
\item A segmentation fault in the slapd LDAP server process in cases where
non-UTF-8 passwords were used for LDAP bind against the \{K5KEY\} scheme has
been fixes (\ucsBug{31352}).

\item When slapd can not be started by its initscript, slapschema is called to determine the cause and the output is displayed (\ucsBug{23055}).

\item The slapcat output could get truncated during univention-ldap-backup.
This issue has been fixed (\ucsBug{31170}).

\item The unused \ucsUCRV{ldap/server/additional} has been removed from \ucsName{univention-ldap}; use \ucsCommand{\ucsBCindex{ldap/server/addition}} instead (\ucsBug{24507}).

the value of \ucsCommand{windows/domain} on the DC master (\ucsBug{24442}).

\end{itemize}


\section{Univention Management Console}

\subsection{Univention Management Console web interface}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed regression in form validation with certain FormWidgets
  (\ucsBug{30965}).
\item Fixed width of ConfirmDialog in Firefox (\ucsBug{30102}).
\item The width of \emph{textarea} fields has been fixed
  (\ucsBug{30889}).
\item A problem in the Text widget has been corrected which caused to
  a 404 error (\ucsBug{28810}).
\item Inside the ,,favorite'' category, favorites can no longer be
  removed (\ucsBug{29555}).
\item The username input field of the login dialog stays disabled
  after a failed relogin (\ucsBug{27989}).
\item A problem with scrollbars in the Dialog widget has been
  corrected (\ucsBug{30796}).
\item UMC login problems with the demo configuration package installed have
  been corrected (\ucsBug{31091}).
\item The internal caching mechanism for list entries (e.g., DHCP/DNS
  entries and IP/MAC addresses for computers) has been improved as it
  could previously lead to inconsistencies in rare cases (\ucsBug{31510}).
\item The \ucsName{univention-demo-configuration} package has been
  updated in order to allow two new \emph{UMCP} commands. The former
  package version leads to an error message when opening the
  \ucsName{App center} or the \ucsName{Online Updater} UMC module. This
  issue has been fixed (\ucsBug{31567}).
\item The validate function of the \emph{Form} widget has been corrected.
  Previously, no exclamation mark has been displayed when a widget had an
  invalid value (\ucsBug{31337}).
\item A static array reference in \ucsName{umc/widgets/MultiSelect} causing re-occurring
  entries in \ucsName{umc/widgets/MultiUploader} has been corrected (\ucsBug{31318}).
\item As page URLs for Piwik, only the origin host without path is specified (\ucsBug{30961}).
\item In \ucsName{umc/widgets/Grid:actions} a specify tooltip class can now be defined for actions (\ucsBug{31308}).

\item Problems with standby overlay animations not covering the full underlying area have been corrected (\ucsBug{31581});
\item The actions saving and cancel editing UDM objects are published now for the Piwik system (\ucsBug{31161}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Univention Management Console server}
\begin{itemize}
\item Unexpected errors that caused \ucsName{UMC} server and modules to exit are now logged (\ucsBug{31130}).

\item The UMC ACL evaluation has been simplified which improves the UMC login
  performance (\ucsBug{28059}).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Univention App Center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed an issue when closing the App Center tab in the Management Console:
  The backend shut down the module when no further requests regarding the
  progress of an installation was sent. When this happened during installation
  the package database could become temporarily broken (\ucsBug{30611}).
\item Prevent concurrent package operations in the same session
  (\ucsBug{31382}).
\item Added a progress bar while fetching software changes in App Center and
  speeded up the process of retrieving this information (\ucsBug{30798}).
\item Made free memory calculation more robust in OpenVZ environments
  (\ucsBug{30659}).
\item Added switch to install the latest version of the application in
  \ucsName{univention-add-app} (\ucsBug{31157}).
\item Fixed app installation with --all and --master when pointing to an
  outdated app version in \ucsName{univention-add-app} (\ucsBug{31279}).
\item The full progress bar is used while installing an application when not
  installing packages on other servers in the domain (\ucsBug{31184}).
\item If an application is installed, the system does not dist-upgrade anymore.
  If the app is upgraded, the system still does a dist-upgrade but shows a
  warning that the dist-upgrade may include errata updates (\ucsBug{31129},
  \ucsBug{31278}).
\item The button to request a new license is shown even when the application
  cannot be installed (\ucsBug{31166}).
\item A typo in the command line tool
  \emph{univention-management-console-client} has been corrected
  (\ucsBug{30605}).
\item \emph{UNIVENTION\_DEBUG\_BEGIN} and \emph{UNIVENTION\_DEBUG\_END}
  information are no longer logged (\ucsBug{29603}).
\item Fixed resolving dependencies of packages: Errors from apt are handled
  correctly (\ucsBug{31055}).
\item Under certain circumstances packages installed directly by the App Center
  could be marked as automatically installed and thus be autoremoved. This has
  been corrected (\ucsBug{31155}).
\item A problem which caused to crash the UMC server when setting an
  invalid locale has been corrected (\ucsBug{28657}).
\item Fixed a segfault that happened while upgrading an app under certain
  circumstances. Now the package manager always uses the latest package cache
  (\ucsBug{31282}).
\item Checking hardware requirements when upgrading an app has been disabled
  (\ucsBug{31354}).
\item Opening a second App Center module in UMC is now prevented and a traceback
  when opening the module has been corrected (\ucsBug{31662}).
\item Added a link to the campaign ``Vote for app!'' (\ucsBug{31625}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Univention Management Console / Univention Directory Manager modules}
\begin{itemize}
\item The UCS license check now ignores temporary user objects (\ucsBug{31167}).
\item The attributes ,,User ID'', ,,Group ID'' and ,,GECOS'' in the users module, ,,FQDN'' in the computers
  module and ,,Next IP'' in the network module have been removed from the advanced search as they
  are not searchable in the UMC (\ucsBug{28803}).
\item A broken LDAP authentification in \ucsName{proof\_dns\_dhcp\_records} has been corrected (\ucsBug{30903}).
\item The following syntax classes received lookup optimizations
  which result in faster object opening especially in larger environments:
  \ucsName{UserDN}, \ucsName{UserID}, \ucsName{GroupDN}, \ucsName{GroupID}, \ucsName{UCS\_Server},
  \ucsName{DNS\_ForwardZone}, \ucsName{DNS\_ReverseZone}, \ucsName{WritableShare},
  \ucsName{DomainController}, \ucsName{GroupName}, \ucsName{UserName}, \ucsName{nfsShare}
  (\ucsBug{30991}, \ucsBug{31560}).
\item All syntax files and hooks files are re-evaluated every time a new
  session is created. This prevents errors caused by referenced classes unknown
  during \ucsName{univention-management-console-server} startup
  (\ucsBug{31154}).
\item The debug output is now explicitly flushed in order to prevent
  partial or missing lines in the log file (\ucsBug{31421}).
\item Removed duplicate mapping.register call for univentionInventoryNumber (\ucsBug{24102}).
\item The package \ucsName{univention-admingrp-user-passwordreset} has been updated to work with \ucsName{UCS 3.2} (\ucsBug{25408}).
\item The wording has been adapted (\ucsBug{24727}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Basic settings / Univention System Setup}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ucsUCRV{apache2/startsite} will be set to correct values when reinstalling, 
uninstalling and updating univention-system-setup-boot (\ucsBug{31385} \ucsBug{31643}).
\item Added error handling in case the download of required packages for
\ucsName{univention-system-setup-boot} failed. This could prevent a
role switch when configuring the system in appliance setup (\ucsBug{30896}).
\item Disabled Firefox update popups during appliance setup (\ucsBug{30980}).

\item The windows domain name is no longer queried (or displayed) in the basic
settings on non  DC master systems (\ucsBug{24442}).

\item Fixed an infinite loop when validating the domainname and windows domainname (\ucsBug{28574}).

\item The URL to a \ucsName{SDB} article has been internationalized (\ucsBug{30776}).

\item The SSL fields are now updated autoamtically during appliance setup (\ucsBug{29658}).

\item Added support to configure Bridge, Bond and VLAN devices (\ucsBug{30816}, \ucsBug{30878}).

\item Wording of \ucsName{DC Slave} has been unified (\ucsBug{30773}).

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Users module}
\begin{itemize}
\item Spaces are no longer allowed in the username (this can be overwritten by setting the
\ucsUCRV{directory/manager/web/modules/users/user/properties/username/syntax} to \emph{string}, \ucsBug{19441}).
\item Some old code has been removed (\ucsBug{28671}).
\item The mail option is not connected to any password related properties anymore (\ucsBug{31868}).
\item A traceback which occured when creating a user with just the person option set has been corrected (\ucsBug{24351}).

  zones has been fixed (\ucsBug{29681}).
\item The pointer record attribute of the DNS pointer module is now a multi
value attribute (\ucsBug{28667}, \ucsBug{31103}).
\item The term ,,UDM Web'' in the extended attributes module has been replaced
  by ,,UMC'' (\ucsBug{27948}).
\item The english and german texts of the \emph{System information}
  module have been adapted (\ucsBug{30797}).
\item Support of ext4 partitions has been added to the filesystem quota module
  (\ucsBug{24357}).

  adapted. Furthermore the \emph{cancel} button in the confirmation
  dialog is the default now (\ucsBug{22831}).
\item The use of eval() has been replaced with getattr() in several \ucsName{UMC} modules (\ucsBug{31523}).
\item The \ucsName{Software monitor} module has been reworked (\ucsBug{30967}, \ucsBug{29655}, \ucsBug{24360}, \ucsBug{24633}, \ucsBug{9706}, \ucsBug{28787}, \ucsBug{28804}, \ucsBug{29610}).
\item The \ucsName{VNC} module has been removed (\ucsBug{30158}).
\item The search pattern have been more secured and unified in \ucsName{UVMM} and \ucsName{Printers} module (\ucsBug{28260}).

\item Samba 3 does now support quota on XFS file systems like expected, for example the calculation of the partition limit or the used space (\ucsBug{31210}).
\item There is now a service definition for \ucsName{winbind} (\ucsBug{9560}).
\item The winbind init script did not ensure that the daemon actually got stopped. This could lead
 to a non running winbind daemon after the server password change. This issue has been fixed
 (\ucsBug{31289}).
\item The file \ucsFile{/etc/samba/shares.conf} is now refreshed directly after changing a share (\ucsBug{29399}).
\item The configuration of the \ucsUCRV{windows/domain} has been removed from
the postinst script of \ucsName{univention-samba} (\ucsBug{24442}).
\item \ucsUCRV{windows/wins-server} and \ucsUCRV{windows/wins-support} are now set in the Samba joinscript (\ucsBug{31814}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Samba 4}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ucsUCRV{windows/wins-server} and \ucsUCRV{windows/wins-support} are now initialized during join (\ucsBug{30813}).
\item Samba 4 does now support quota on XFS file systems (\ucsBug{31234}).
\item Joining into a new \ucsName{samba4/join/site} without Samba4 on the Master now repects the chosen \ucsName{samba4/dc} (\ucsBug{30792}).
\item The sysvol-sync.py script did not preserve timestamps, now it does (\ucsBug{30823}).
\item The sysvol-cleanup.py script moved the PolicyDefinitions away. Now it considers only GPO paths (\ucsBug{31186}).
\item The unused UCR variables \ucsUCRV{samba/client\_use\_spnego} and \ucsUCRV{samba/time\_server} has been removed (\ucsBug{26389}).
\item Periodic refresh of sysvol fACLs for the group Authenticated Users can
now be disabled with the new \ucsUCRV{samba4/sysvol/sync/setfacl/AU} \ucsBug{31271}).
\item Samba4 DCs are now added to the group Enterprise Domain Controllers
by default during initial join (\ucsBug{31437}).
\item The listener module samba4-idmap now also works in case smb.conf includes files readable
only for root (\ucsBug{31538}).
\item Fixed file permissions of \ucsFile{/var/lib/samba/ntp\_signd} (\ucsBug{31109}).
\item To minimize the time where \ucsURL{/etc/samba/shares.conf} includes non-existing files, it is now updated directly after a share was added/removed or renamed (\ucsBug{31800}).
\item In case a Samba 4 service is detected in the domain during join, UCS LDAP servers now take care that they are not registered with port 7389 in the \_ldap.\_tcp SRV DNS record (\ucsBug{29462}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Univention S4 Connector}
\begin{itemize}
\item The attribute sambaMaxPwdAge can be set to -1 in OpenLDAP. This will
  now be mapped to 0 in Samba 4 since -1 is not allowed for the attribute
  maxPwdAge (\ucsBug{29775}).
\item Samba4 DCs are now added to the group Enterprise Domain Controllers (\ucsBug{31437}).
\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Univention Active Directory Connector}
%\begin{itemize}
%\end{itemize}


\section{UCS test framework}
\begin{itemize}
\item A test has been added to check if the ,,Administrator'' user may execute
  \ucsCommand{univention-directory-manager users/user list --filter uid=Administrator} (\ucsBug{30116}).

\item A test case for \ucsName{univention-dnsedit} has been added (\ucsBug{31104}).

\item A test case for the server password change has been added (\ucsBug{31295}).

\item The function \ucsName{user\_create} from the internal test framework now checks whether the
mail domain exists or not. If the mail domain for the local domain does not exist the user is
created without a mail address (\ucsBug{31296}).
\item The test case for validating that groupname LDAP locking objects
  are removed properly will not be executed on DC slaves anymore
  (\ucsBug{11417})
\item The UCR variables \ucsUCRV{tests/domainadmin/account},
    \ucsUCRV{tests/domainadmin/pwd} and \ucsUCRV{tests/domainadmin/pwdfile}
    have been added. They can be used to configure which domain administrator
    credentials UCS test should use when running tests (\ucsBug{31250}).

\item The connector tests have been reordered to avoid a connector restart for every test (\ucsBug{31677}).

\item The different return codes of ucs-test have been merged (\ucsBug{31734}).

\item New functions have been added to get a better support of non DC Master
systems in \ucsName{ucs-test}, for example \ucsName{udm-test} or
\ucsName{wait\_for\_replication}. The existing test cases have been adapted
(\ucsBug{31687}, \ucsBug{31678}, \ucsBug{31679}, \ucsBug{31680}).

\item The winbind test has been improved to work more reliable on UCS memberservers in Samba4 domains (\ucsBug{31772}).

\item Now there is a test block \emph{samba-common} for tests that are common to Samba versions 3 and 4.
The robustness against DRS and rsync replication delays has been improved in some tests (\ucsBug{28343}, \ucsBug{28348}, \ucsBug{29057}, \ucsBug{29058}, \ucsBug{29062}). The Samba3 join test has been removed (\ucsBug{31835}). Samba4 NTACL tests have been improved a bit (\ucsBug{29230}).

\item Under certain circumstances samba 3.6.8 reports a timeout for the unix password sync during password changes. Since the password change is successful nonetheless, two test cases have been adjusted to tolerate this flaw (\ucsBug{31794}).

\item Several UDM test cases have been added (\ucsBug{31652}, \ucsBug{31653}, \ucsBug{31654}, \ucsBug{31655}, \ucsBug{31656}, \ucsBug{31658}).

\item The tools \ucsName{import\_ldif\_with\_listener}, \ucsName{import\_ldif\_without\_listener}
and an example customer LDIF with 5000 users and other objects have been added to
\ucsName{ucs-test-tools} (\ucsBug{29418}).

\item A test case to check if the packages of the requested apps are installed have been added (\ucsBug{31793}).

\end{itemize}

\section{Other changes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \ucsName{univention-user-quota} has been rewritten in python. It does
  now support share names with whitespaces (\ucsBug{30636}).
\item The drbd8 userland tools have been updated to version 8.3.11 (\ucsBug{31321}).
\item Shell escaping in \ucsName{univention-home-mounter} has been fixed (\ucsBug{19441}).
\item \ucsName{univention-backup2master} now also replaces the
\ucsUCRV{kerberos/adminserver} with the new masters's FQDN (\ucsBug{31077}).
\item Deprecated checks for some multivalue attributes have been removed (\ucsBug{18929}).
