			An overview of the most important changes:

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>
				The Univention App Center integrates the container technology Docker. With Docker, it is
				possible to run Apps separately and encapsulated from each other. This
				increases the security of the UCS domain and reduces the dependencies of the Apps on
				other software libraries.
				The integration of Docker is transparent to the users. The App Center will
				automatically perform the startup and configuration of the Docker containers.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				The Univention App Center's usability has been improved further. Apps are now
				displayed more clearly. The App detail pages have been cleaned up and supplemented by
				a rating in the categories Vendor Supported, Popularity's Award and
				Editor's Award.
				The classification is based on data such as the installation base of the Apps or
				the maintenance behavior of the App providers. Thus, the transparency and
				comparability of Apps are increased.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				Single-sign-on via SAML is a product component from UCS 4.1 and works out of the box
				with the UCS management system. Once logged in, you can switch between web
				applications without an additional login.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				Users can independently change their password or reset it in case of a forgotten
				password via the new Self Service. In this case, a token will be sent to an e-mail
				address or mobile phone number that has to be defined in advance by the users.
				The then received token can be used to set a new password.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				The Linux kernel has been updated to the latest stable version of the 4.1 longterm
				kernel. This includes several security updates as well as new and updated drivers
				for better hardware support.
			</para></listitem>
			<listitem><para>
				Samba has been updated to version 4.3.1. Besides many detail improvements, Samba 4.3
				provides support for SMB 3.1.1, which was introduced by Microsoft with Windows
				10 and provides security improvements and more features.
			</para></listitem>

	<chapter id="relnotes:update">
		<title>Notes about the update</title>
		<para>
			During the update some services in the domain may not be available temporarily, that is why the update should occur in a maintenance window.
			It is recommended to test the update in a separate test environment prior to the actual update.
			The test environment should be identical to the production environment.
			Depending on the system performance, network connection and the installed software the update will take between 20 minutes and several hours.
		</para>

		<section id="relnotes:order">
			<title>Recommended update order for environments with more than one UCS server</title>
			<para>
				In environments with more than one UCS system, the update order of the UCS systems must be borne in mind:
			</para>

			<para>
				The authoritative version of the LDAP directory service is maintained on the &ucsMaster; and replicated to all the remaining LDAP servers of the UCS domain.
				As changes to the LDAP schema can occur during release updates, the &ucsMaster; must always be the first system to be updated during a release update.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:apps">
			<title>Univention App Center</title>
			<para>
				If applications have been installed from the Univention App Center, the update can only be performed once all installed applications are available in a compatible version.
				Some applications are updated to newer versions during the UCS update.
				If an application is not yet available for UCS 4.1, a statement about the release date can be obtained from the application provider.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:32bit">
			<title>UCS installation DVD only available for 64 bit</title>
			<para>
				Starting with UCS 4.0, installation DVD are only provided for the x86 64 bit architecture (amd64).
				Existing 32 bit UCS 3 systems can still be updated to UCS 4.0 through the online repository or by using update DVD.
				The 32 bit architecture will be supported over the entire UCS 4 maintenance period.
			</para>
		</section>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:prepare">
		<title>Preparation of update</title>

		<para>
			It must be checked whether sufficient disk space is available.
			A standard installation requires a minimum of 6 GB of disk space.
			Depending on the scope of the existing installation, the update will require about another 2 GB of disk space for download and installation all packages.
		</para>

		<para>
			For the update, a login should be performed on the system's local console as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, and the update should be initiated there.
			Alternatively, the update can be conducted using &ucsUMC;.
		</para>

		<para>
			Remote updating via SSH is not recommended as this may result in the update procedure being canceled, e.g., if the network connection is interrupted.
			In consequence, this can affect the system severely.
			If updating should occur over a network connection nevertheless, it must be verified that the update continues in case of disconnection from the network.
			This can be achieved, e.g., using the tools <command>screen</command> and <command>at</command>.  These tools are installed on all UCS system roles by default.
		</para>
		<section id="relnotes:removed">
			<title>Removed/unsupported Components</title>
			<para>
				Some components have been removed and are not shipped any longer with UCS 4.1:
			</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						<application>PostgreSQL 8.4</application> is no longer provided in UCS 4.1. The
						migration of existing databases to PostgreSQL 9.1 is described in <u:sdb>1292</u:sdb>.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</section>
	</chapter>

	<chapter id="relnotes:post">
		<title>Postprocessing of the update</title>

		<para>
			Following the update, new or updated join scripts need to be executed.
			This can be done in two ways:
			Either using the UMC module  <guimenu>Domain join</guimenu> or by running the command <command>univention-run-join-scripts</command> as user <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>.
		</para>

		<para>
			Subsequently the UCS system needs to be restarted.
		</para>

	<chapter id="relnotes:packages">
		<title>Further notes on selected packages</title>

		<section id="relnotes:usage">
			<title>Collection of usage statistics</title>
			<para>
				Anonymous usage statistics on the use of &ucsUMC; are collected when using the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> (which is generally used for evaluating UCS).
				The modules opened are logged in an instance of the web traffic analysis tool Piwik.
				This makes it possible for Univention to tailor the development of &ucsUMC; better to customer needs and carry out usability improvements.
			</para>
			<para>
				This logging is only performed when the <emphasis>UCS Core Edition</emphasis> license is used.
				The license status can be verified via the menu entry <guimenu>License &ar; License information</guimenu> of the user menu in the upper right corner of &ucsUMC;.
				If <guimenu>UCS Core Edition</guimenu> is listed under <guimenu>License type</guimenu>, this version is in use.
				When a regular UCS license is used, no usage statistics are collected.
			</para>
			<para>
				Independent of the license used, the statistics generation can be deactivated by setting the &ucsUCRV; <envar>umc/web/piwik</envar> to <emphasis>false</emphasis>.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:secbrowsers">
			<title>Scope of security support for WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit</title>
			<para>
				WebKit, Konqueror and QtWebKit are shipped in the maintained branch of the UCS repository, but not covered by security support.
				WebKit is primarily used for displaying HTML help pages etc.
				Firefox should be used as web browser.
			</para>

		</section>

		<section id="relnotes:browsers">
			<title>Recommended browsers for the access to Univention Management Console</title>

			<para>
				&ucsUMC; uses numerous JavaScript and CSS functions to display the web interface.
				Cookies need to be permitted in the browser.
				The following browsers are recommended:
			</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>Chrome as of version 33</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>Firefox as of version 24</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>Internet Explorer as of version 9</para>
				</listitem>

				<listitem>
					<para>Safari and Safari Mobile as of version 7</para>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		<section id="relnotes:maintained">
			<title>Handling of <phrase>maintained</phrase> and <phrase>unmaintained</phrase> packages</title>
				<para>
					With UCS 4.1 the handling of <phrase>maintained</phrase> and <phrase>unmaintained</phrase> packages has been changed.
				</para>
				<itemizedlist spacing="compact">
					<listitem><simpara>
							The <emphasis>Installation DVD</emphasis> now only contains the packages required to install a new UCS system with all the components provided by Univention.
							Previously the DVD contained all other <phrase>maintained</phrase> packages too.
							They have been removed from the DVD to decrease the download size.
					</simpara></listitem>
					<listitem><simpara>
							The full set of <phrase>maintained</phrase> packages is provided through the <emphasis>Update DVD</emphasis>.
							It can be used to update a local repository.
					</simpara></listitem>
					<listitem><simpara>
							All packages (<phrase>maintained</phrase> and <phrase>unmaintained</phrase>) are available online through <ulink url="https://updates.software-univention.de/"/>.
					</simpara></listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
				<para>
					With this change the definition of <phrase>maintained</phrase> also changed:
					<phrase>maintained</phrase> is now defined on the basis of the <emphasis>source package</emphasis>, while previously it was defined on a subset of <emphasis>binary packages</emphasis>.
					This might lead to an increased space requirement for local repositories, as <phrase>maintained</phrase> now consists of more packages than in previous releases.
