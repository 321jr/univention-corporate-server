			It was developed for UCS 3.2 but can also be used for UCS 3.1.

			This section describes all steps necessary to create a working translation package for UCS.
			To create a new translation package it is advised to have a running UCS server where the package can be setup.
			A current Subversion checkout of the UCS source code is required.
			After installing the translation template package, a new translation for a target language can be created.

				The following steps are required to setup a UCS server to create a new translation package.

					<varlistentry>
						<term>Package <package>univention-ucs-translation-template</package></term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								The package <package>univention-ucs-translation-template</package> contains all tools required to setup and update a translation package.
								It requires some additional Debian tools to build the package.
								The following packages must be installed on an UCS server by running the following command:
								<programlisting language="sh">
<!-- TODO: this line is valid for 3.2: univention-install univention-ucs-translation-template dpkg-dev -->
univention-install univention-management-console-dev dpkg-dev
								</programlisting>
								<!-- TODO: Remove from here with UCS 3.2 -->
								The translation package is not officially provided for UCS 3.1.
								It has to be downloaded and installed manually by executing the following commands:
								<programlisting language="sh">
wget http://testing.univention.de/3.2/unmaintained/3.2-0/all/univention-ucs-translation-template_1.0.0-2.2.201308151213_all.deb
dpkg -i univention-ucs-translation-template_1.0.0-2.2.201308151213_all.deb

						<term>A current checkout of the UCS Subversion repository</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								The base translation files are available in the UCS Subversion repository.
								A current checkout can be obtained by running the following commands:
							</para>
								<programlisting language="sh">
mkdir ~/translation
cd ~/translation
svn co http://forge.univention.org/svn/dev/branches/ucs-3.1/ucs-3.1-1
								</programlisting>
								<!-- TODO: Use &websvn; after it has been updated -->
							<para>
								Changes made to the &ucsUMC; should be synchronized regularly to the local Subversion checkout.
								This can be done by executing <command>svn up ~/translation/ucs-3.1-1</command>.

			<title>Create a new translation package</title>
			<para>
				To create a new translation package for e.g. French in the users home directory, the following command must be executed:
				<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation
univention-ucs-translation-build-package \
	-s ~/translation/ucs-3.1-1 -c fr -l fr_FR.UTF-8:UTF-8 -n French
				</programlisting>
				This creates a new directory <filename class="directory">univention-ucs-translation-fr/</filename>, which contains a Debian source package of the same name.
				It includes all source and target files for the translation.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="misc:translation:translate">
			<title>Edit translation files</title>
			<para>
				The translation source files are located below the directory <filename class="directory">fr/</filename>.
				Each file should be edited to create the translation.
				There are two file formats in common use:
			</para>
				<variablelist>
					<varlistentry>
						<term><filename class="extension">.po</filename> files</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								These files are generated by the package gettext. 
								The gettext manual can be found at <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html"/>.
								Translation files created by gettext consist of a header and various entries of the form
							</para>
								<programlisting>
#: umc/app.js:637
#, python-format
msgid "The %s will expire in %d days and should be renewed!"
msgstr ""
								</programlisting>
							<para>
								The first line provides a hint, were the text is used.
								The second line is optional and contains flags, which indicate the type and state of the translation.
								The string <literal>fuzzy</literal> indicates an entry, which was copied by <command>gettext</command> from a previous version and needs to be updated.
								The flag has to be removed afterwards.
							</para>
							<para>
								The line starting with <literal>msgid</literal> contains the original text.
								The translation has to be placed on the line containing <literal>msgstr</literal>.
								Long texts can be split over multiple lines, were each line must start and end with a quote.
								The following example from the German translation shows a text spanning two lines, with the placeholder present in the original and translated text.
								<programlisting>
#: umc/js/appcenter/AppCenterPage.js:1067
#, python-format
msgid ""
"If everything else went correct and this is just a temporary network "
"problem, you should execute %s as root on that backup system."
msgstr ""
"Wenn keine weiteren Fehler auftraten und dies nur ein temporäres "
"Netzwerkproblem ist, sollten Sie %s als root auf dem Backup System ausführen."
								</programlisting>
							</para>
							<para>
								Some lines contain parameters, in this example <literal>%s</literal> and <literal>%d</literal>.
								They are indicated by a flag like <literal>c-format</literal> or <literal>python-format</literal>, which must not be removed.
								The placeholders have to be carried over to the translated string unmodified and in the same order.
								Some other files contain placeholders of the form <literal>%{text}s</literal>, which are more flexible and can be reordered.
							</para>
							<para>
								After a file has been translated completely, the line containing <literal>fuzzy</literal> at the beginning of the file should be removed to avoid warnings.
								If a translation string consists of multiple lines the translated string should roughly contain as many lines as the original string.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>

					<varlistentry>
						<term><filename class="extension">.html</filename> files</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								Some &ucsUMC; dialogues are based on <acronym>HTML</acronym> files.
								In this case a copy of the English <acronym>HTML</acronym> file is provided with a new name for the target language.
								The full file has to be translated.

		<section id="misc:translation:updatepackage">
			<title>Update the translation package</title>
			<para>
				The following steps are needed to upgrade the translation to a new UCS release, or if changes have been made in the translation.
				<variablelist>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Update translation source files</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								If changes occur in the UCS source packages that need a change of the translation files, the source files should be updated.
								To update the source files, change the directory of the translation package and update the files by executing the following commands:
							</para>
							<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr
univention-ucs-translation-update-source-files \
	-s ~/translation/ucs-3.1-1 -c fr
							</programlisting>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
					<varlistentry>
						<term>Update translation target files</term>
						<listitem>
						<important>
							<para>
								This step is necessary each time before compiling the translation package.
								If the translation target files are not updated, the translation will not be shown in the &ucsUMC;
							</para>
						</important>
							<para>
								After the translation the source files have to be compiled.
								This step can also be done in an early stage of the translation, when it is not yet complete.
								To update the target files, change to the directory of the translation package and compile the source files by executing the following commands:
							</para>
							<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr
univention-ucs-translation-update-target-files \
	-s ~/translation/ucs-3.1-1 -c fr
							</programlisting>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="misc:translation:buildpackage">
			<title>Build the translation package</title>
			<para>
				Before using the new translation, the Debian package has to be built and installed.
				This can be done with the following commands:
				<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr
dpkg-buildpackage 
dpkg -i ../univention-ucs-translation-fr_*.deb
				</programlisting>
				After logging out of the &ucsUMC; the new language should now be selectable in the &ucsUMC; login window.
				Untranslated strings will be still shown in their original language, i.e. in English.
