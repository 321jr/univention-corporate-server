		<remark></remark>

		<para>
			By default UCS includes English and German localizations.
			Univention provides a set of tools that facilitates the process of creating translations for &ucsUMC;.
		</para>
		<para>
			This section describes all steps necessary to create a working translation package for UCS.
			We recommend having a running UCS installation where the tools can be set up in an easy manner.
			Further more a current Subversion checkout of the UCS source code is required.
		</para>

		<section id="misc:translation:preparation">
			<title>Install needed tools</title>
			<para>
				The package <package>univention-ucs-translation-template</package> contains all tools required to setup and update a translation package.
				It requires some additional Debian tools to build the package.
				Run the following command on your UCS to install all needed packages.
				<programlisting language="sh">
univention-install univention-ucs-translation-template dpkg-dev subversion
				</programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="misc:translation:checkoutsvn">
			<title>Obtain a current checkout of the UCS Subversion repository</title>
			<para>
				The Subversion repository is later processed to get initial files for a new translation(often referred to as PO file or Portable Objects).
				<programlisting language="sh">
mkdir ~/translation
cd ~/translation
svn co http://forge.univention.org/svn/dev/branches/ucs-4.1/ucs-4.1-3
				</programlisting>
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="misc:translation:createpackage">
			<title>Create a new translation package</title>
			<para>
				To create a new translation package for, e.g., French in the current working directory, the following command must be executed:
				<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation
univention-ucs-translation-build-package \
    -s ~/translation/ucs-4.1-3 -c fr -l fr_FR.UTF-8:UTF-8 -n French
				</programlisting>
				This creates a new directory <filename class="directory">~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr/</filename>, which contains a Debian source package of the same name.
				It includes all source and target files for the translation.
			</para>
		</section>

		<section id="misc:translation:translate">
			<title>Edit translation files</title>
			<para>
				The translation source files are located below the directory <filename class="directory">~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr/fr</filename>.
				Each file should be edited to create the translation.
				There are two file formats in common use:
			</para>
				<variablelist>
					<varlistentry>
						<term><filename class="extension">.po</filename> files</term>
						<listitem>
							<para>
								These files are generated by the package <package>gettext</package>.
								The manual can be found at <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html"/>.
								Translation files created by <package>gettext</package> consist of a header and various entries of the form
							</para>
							<programlisting>
#: umc/app.js:637
#, python-format
msgid "The %s will expire in %d days and should be renewed!"
msgstr ""
							</programlisting>
							<para>
								The first line provides a hint, were the text is used.
								The second line is optional and contains flags, which indicate the type and state of the translation.
								The string <literal>fuzzy</literal> indicates an entry, which was copied by <command>gettext</command> from a previous version and needs to be updated.
							</para>
							<para>
								The line starting with <literal>msgid</literal> contains the original text.
								The translation has to be placed on the line containing <literal>msgstr</literal>.
								Long texts can be split over multiple lines, were each line must start and end with a double-quote.
								The following example from the German translation shows a text spanning two lines, with the placeholder present in the original and translated text.
							</para>
							<programlisting>
#: umc/js/appcenter/AppCenterPage.js:1067
#, python-format
msgid ""
"If everything else went correct and this is just a temporary network "
"problem, you should execute %s as root on that backup system."
msgstr ""
"Wenn keine weiteren Fehler auftraten und dies nur ein temporäres "
"Netzwerkproblem ist, sollten Sie %s als root auf dem Backup System ausführen."
							</programlisting>
							<para>
								Some lines contain parameters, in this example <literal>%s</literal> and <literal>%d</literal>.
								They are indicated by a flag like <literal>c-format</literal> or <literal>python-format</literal>, which must not be removed.
								The placeholders have to be carried over to the translated string unmodified and in the same order.
								Some other files contain placeholders of the form <literal>%{text}s</literal>, which are more flexible and can be reordered.
							</para>
							<para>
								After a file has been translated completely, the line containing <literal>fuzzy</literal> at the beginning of the entry should be removed to avoid warnings.
								If a translation string consists of multiple lines the translated string should roughly contain as many lines as the original string.
							</para>
						</listitem>
					</varlistentry>
				</variablelist>

		<section id="misc:translation:updatepackage">
			<title>Update the translation package</title>
			<para>
				First update your Subversion checkout:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation/ucs-4.1-3
svn update
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				If changes affecting translations are made in the Subversion repository, existing translation packages need to be updated to reflect those changes.
				Given a path to an updated Subversion checkout, <command>univention-ucs-translation-merge</command> can update a previously created translation source package. 
				The following example will update the translation package <package>univention-ucs-translation-fr/</package>:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="sh">
univention-ucs-translation-merge ~/translation/ucs-4.1-3 \
    ~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr
			</programlisting>
		</section>

		<section id="misc:translation:buildpackage">
			<title>Build the translation package</title>
			<para>
				Before using the new translation, the Debian package has to be built and installed.
				This can be done with the following commands:
			</para>
			<programlisting language="sh">
cd ~/translation/univention-ucs-translation-fr
dpkg-buildpackage -uc -us -b
dpkg -i ../univention-ucs-translation-fr_*.deb
			</programlisting>
			<para>
				After logging out of the &ucsUMC; the new language should now be selectable in the &ucsUMC; login window.
				Untranslated strings will be still shown in their original language, i.e. in English.
			</para>
