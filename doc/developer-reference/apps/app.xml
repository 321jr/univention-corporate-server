			This chapter is a draft and work in progress! Feedback is very much
			appreciated.

	<para>
		The Univention App Center provides a platform for software vendors and an
		easy-to-use entry point for &ucsUCS; to extend their environment with
		business software.
	</para>

	<section id="app:package">
		<title>Packaging for the App Center</title>
		<para>
			The App Center reuses the package system from Debian (and &ucsUCS;
			itself). In fact installing an application from withing the App Center is
			technically (a bit more than) adding a new repository to the system (one
			that lies on the App Center Server) and <command>apt-get
				install</command>ing the requested package. This means that 3rd party
			vendors need to package their application as a <literal>.deb</literal>
			file and send that to Univention.
		</para>
		<para>
			It is recommended (and probably necessary) to provide at least one
			additional package that arranges for deeper integration into &ucsUCS;.
			This package could be named
			<package>univention-<replaceable>appname</replaceable></package> and have
			a Dependency on the core application (on <literal>dpkg</literal> level).
			Depending on whether the application wants to extend the LDAP another
			(independent) package needs to be provided, say,
			<package>univention-<replaceable>appname</replaceable></package>. It does
			not need to be installed on each system the core application is installed
			but needs to stay installed even when the core application is removed.
			Thus it should be as independent as possible from the the core
			application (and
			<package>univention-<replaceable>appname</replaceable></package>).
		</para>
		<para>
			See <xref linkend="chap:debian"/> for further details on how to build
			Debian packages.
		</para>
	</section>
	<section id="app:files">
		<title>Additional files to be shipped with the application</title>
		<para>
			The App Center needs some meta information about the application to
			handle the installation and to present information to the user. The
			application needs a so-called <literal>ini-file</literal> for that.
		</para>
		<para>
			A minimal example along with some comments on the variables is attached:
		</para>
		<programlisting language="ini"><xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" href="application.ini" parse="text"/></programlisting>
		<para>
			This file needs to be shipped with the application and should be updated
			with each new version of the application at least changing
			<literal>Version</literal>.
		</para>
		<para>
			A few variables need further explanation:
		</para>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>ID</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						Needs to stay the same all the time. It is used to connect
						different versions.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Version</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						Has to rise every time. Needs to be comparable, i.e. versions
						consisting only of a codename are not useful. In the App Center,
						only the newest version (or the currently installed one) is shown.
						It is possible to install one specific version but this needs
						knowledge of internal IDs (beyond control even for the application
						vendor).
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>MinPhysicalRAM</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						The minimal amount of free memory in MB when trying to install the
						application. The application should work fluently above that limit
						at least for smaller environments. If this limit is set very high
						many testers will be unable to install this application as there is
						no easy way to skip this test.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>RequiredApps</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						Application IDs for apps that need to be installed in order to run
						this one correctly. These applications will not be installed
						automatically if not installed yet but the user has to explicitely
						install them after getting a message which applications are
						missing.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>ConflictedSystemPackages</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						Package names that may not be installed along with the application.
						It is highly recommended that this list is reflected on
						<literal>dpkg</literal> level in some other package of the
						application. This list is just to show the user conflicts
						<emphasis>before</emphasis> the application is to be installed.
						Conflicts on package level are resolved automatically and the user
						has to confirm if some packages will be uninstalled. Same for
						<literal>ConflictedApps</literal>.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>DefaultPackages</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A list of packages that will be installed. It is recommended to
						keep this list as small as possible and install other packages as
						Dependencies as this is less error prone. Preferably only a package
						like
						<package>univention-<replaceable>appname</replaceable></package> is
						given here.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>DefaultPackagesMaster</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						Installing an application may require an extension of the LDAP
						schema. This is done by providing a separate package for this
						schema file and install it on the &ucsMaster; (and all &ucsBackup;
						servers). The App Center will install these packages automatically
						throughout the domain â€” in opposite to the
						<literal>DefaultPackages</literal> which are only installed
						locally. Another difference is that these packages will not be
						uninstalled even when the whole application is removed because a
						schema that was used before it is removed again will break the
						whole LDAP server.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
		</variablelist>
		<para>
			There are more files that can be shipped with the Application, each of
			them optionally:
		</para>
		<variablelist>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>Screenshot</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A screenshot showing the application in action. JPG or (preferably)
						PNG.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>LICENSE_AGREEMENT</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A file the user has to accept before the installation starts. As of
						UCS 3.2 HTML in this file is allowed and it may be localised by
						using the files <literal>LICENSE_AGREEMENT_EN</literal> resp.
						<literal>LICENSE_AGREEMENT_DE</literal>.
					</simpara>
					<important>
						<para>
							As stated above HTML in this file is now allowed (and enforced).
							It was not in UCS 3.1 but received some simple auto formatting.
							You may have to convert an existing

						</para>
					</important>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>README_INSTALL</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A file that is presented to the user before installation (but after
						<literal>LICENSE_AGREEMENT</literal>). HTML is allowed. It may be
						localised by using the files <literal>README_INSTALL_EN</literal>
						resp. <literal>README_INSTALL_DE</literal>.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>README_POST_INSTALL</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A file that is presented to the user after installation. HTML is
						allowed. It may be localised by using the files
						<literal>README_POST_INSTALL_EN</literal> resp.
						<literal>README_POST_INSTALL_DE</literal>.
					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</varlistentry>
			<varlistentry>
				<term>README_UPDATE</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A file that is presented to the user before upgrading, listing
						changes. Note that a user may only upgrade to the newest version
						and does so in one step. Only the latest
						<literal>README_UPDATE</literal> is shown.
						As of UCS 3.2 it may be localised by using the files
						<literal>README_UPDATE_EN</literal> resp.
						<literal>README_UPDATE_DE</literal>.

			<varlistentry>
				<term>README</term>
				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						A README file that the user may see in a dedicated Univention
						Management Console Module for the installed application. Should

			Reuse users, groups, computers already administered in domain.
			See <xref linkend="udm:ldap:common-attributes"/>.
		</para>
		<para>
			An Application may need more attributes than there are present. For
			example something like <emphasis>This user is allowed to use the
				app</emphasis>. For this an app will have to extend the LDAP schema
			(this should be done in the <literal>DefaultPackagesMaster</literal> of
			the Application). Furthermore it needs to add Extended Attributes (see
			<xref linkend="udm:ea"/>) in a Join Script (see <xref
				linkend="chap:join"/>) in a package from
			<literal>DefaultPackages</literal>.
