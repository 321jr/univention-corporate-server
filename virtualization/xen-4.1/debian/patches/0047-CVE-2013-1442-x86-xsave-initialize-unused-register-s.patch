Subject: CVE-2013-1442 x86/xsave: initialize unused register state when
 restoring for guest

In order to avoid leaking register contents from the prior use of the
registers restored through xrstor due to a guest enabling certain xcr0
bits late (particularly after the context restor in question), force
restoring of all known registers (the ones that never got saved would
be forced to their init state).

This is CVE-2013-1442 / XSA-62.
