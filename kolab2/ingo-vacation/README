The Horde component "ingo-vacation" is based on "ingo" and relies
heavily on it's internals. If there is an update available for ingo you
probably have to update ingo-vacation as well (manually)!

The main changes are found in the file ingo-vacation/vacation.php which
was originally ingo/vacation.php. This package contains an ingo folder
with all the changed files that may need some adjustment in future
versions.

As you update ingo please make sure that you keep the ingo folder up to
date as well. This will help to maintain this package.
