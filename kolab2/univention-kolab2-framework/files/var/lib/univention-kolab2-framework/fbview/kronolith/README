Need Help?
----------

If you run into problems during the installation, there are multiple
resources as your disposal. It is highly suggested that you consult them
in this order:

    1) The Kronolith documentation (located in the docs/ subdirectory).
    2) The online FAQ available at http://faq.horde.org/.
    3) The searchable mailing list archives, linked from http://horde.org/mail/.
    4) The live mailing lists. More information at http://horde.org/mail/.

Failing to read the documentation before asking a simple question answered
therein will no doubt result in a less-than-welcome response from the mailing
lists. You've been warned. =)
