After almost two years of work, the Horde Team is proud to announce the first
alpha release of the Kronolith Calendar Application version 2.0.

Kronolith is the Horde calendar application. It provides web-based calendars
backed by either a SQL database or the MCAL library. Supported features
include shared calendars, remote calendars, meeting management, alarms,
recurring events, and a sophisticated day/week view which handles arbitrary
numbers of overlapping events.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems.  Some small parts are missing and there are still a few bugs,
some of which are listed below.  You should not use this preview
version over existing production data.

The API, configuration items, or features may change before the final
release, but we encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing
lists or our bug tracking system. Translations are not ready to be updated
yet, since some strings will change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Kronolith 1.x versions are:
    * Shared calendars.
    * Meeting management through iCalendar and iTip messages.
    * Event reminders through email.
    * iCalendar import and export.
    * Generation of free/busy information.
    * Remote calendars.

Known issues:
    * Documentation is not completely updated yet.
