After more than two years of work, the Horde Team is very excited to
announce the first alpha release of the Horde Application Framework
Version 3.0.

The Horde Application Framework is a modular, general-purpose web application
framework written in PHP.  It provides an extensive array of classes that are
targeted at the common problems and tasks involved in developing modern web
applications.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems.  Some small parts are missing and there are still a few bugs,
some of which are listed below.  You should not use this preview
version over existing production data.

The API, configuration items, or features may change before the final
release, but we encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing
lists or our bug tracking system. Translations are not ready to be updated
yet, since some strings will change before the final release.

Horde Version 3 differs from the 2.x releases in many ways, including the
following:
    * Full support for groups and arbitrary permissions.
    * Completely rewritten, fully RFC-compliant MIME system with many
      new MIME viewers.
    * Many i18n improvements, including full charset support for the whole
      framework.
    * User customizable portal page.
    * Theme support.
    * Access (shortcut) keys.
    * DHTML tree menu for applications, including Mozilla sidebar support.
    * XML-based application configuration through a graphical user interface.
    * Forms creation and validation API.
    * Template engine.
    * Crypt API with support for PGP/GPG and S/MIME.
    * XML-RPC and SOAP server and client, SyncML on the way.
    * Improved notification system.
    * Many new APIs like Compress, Image, PDF, History, iCalendar, SyncML,
      CLI, Version control, NLS, Timer, and SVG.

Known issues:
    * Documentation is not completely updated yet.
    * A global interface to identities is missing.
    * If inserting invalid data in a tabbed form (e.g. the configuration
      interface), the tab with the errors is not selected.
