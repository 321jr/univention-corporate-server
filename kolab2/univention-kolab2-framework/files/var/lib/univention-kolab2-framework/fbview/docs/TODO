=================================
|| Horde Development TODO List ||
=================================

- Implement some sort of non-SQL persistent DataTree backend that can
be the default backend so that people don't get non-persistent
DataTree objects. Get rid of the null backend; we pretty much _need_ a
persistent DataTree for Horde 3.0's functionality to work as
advertised.

- Implement admin/deleteUser methods in applications' APIs to delete
user specific data.

- Implement a Horde_Lock class that sits on top of DataTree and
provides locking of any object in the Horde system, like Links
provides relations between any object and Perms provides permissions.

- Add a /services/groups/ section. Include public group homepages,
including any information marked public for the group (let the members
list be marked public/group only/admin only), add group administrators
(just a flag for users), add the ability to show all calendars/other
shares that a group has permissions to, allow creating a new
calendar/poll/etc. for a group.

- Add the ability to break out DataTree group_uids into their own
tables (one table per group).

- Use the freedesktop shared-mime-info XML file
(http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/shared-mime-info) to build our MIME_Magic
magic data files.
