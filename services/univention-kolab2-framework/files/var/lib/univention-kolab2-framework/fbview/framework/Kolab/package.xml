    <date>2004-04-21</date>
    <notes>
     Pretty much a total reorganisation of the library; added a new Kolab_Cyrus
     object to better encapsulate communication with the Cyrus server. Moved and
     in most cases renamed existing functions to fit into the Kolab_Cyrus object,
     and added several new functions.

      <notes>
       - Modified the cyrusMailboxURI() function to properly handle shared
         Cyrus folders.
       - Small change in the openCyrusConnection() function to disable creating
         the specified folder if it is a shared folder, even if the user requests
         otherwise.
       - Removed the compileFreeBusy() functions, as Kronolith:: already provides
         a more robust version.

      <date>2004-01-30</date>
      <notes>
       - Replaced the various iconv() functions with Horde counterparts from
         the MIME:: and String:: libraries.
       - Replaced the Net_HTTP_Client code with its equivalent that uses
         HTTP_Request for GETs, and PHP streams with the WebDAV_Client wrapper
         for WebDAV PUTs.
       - Fixed a small bug in openCyrusConnection() when false was being
         returned (instead of raising Horde::fatal) on a certain error condition.
