The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first alpha release of the Turba
Contact Manager version 2.0.

Turba is the Horde contact management application. It is a production level
address book, and makes heavy use of the Horde framework to provide
integration with IMP and other Horde applications.

This is a preview version that should not be used on production
systems.  Some small parts are missing and there are still a few bugs,
some of which are listed below.  You should not use this preview
version over existing production data.

The API, configuration items, or features may change before the final
release, but we encourage widespread testing and feedback via the mailing
lists or our bug tracking system. Translations are not ready to be updated
yet, since some strings will change before the final release.

The major changes compared to the Turba 1.x versions are:
    * Copying and moving of contacts between different address books.
    * IMSP backend.
    * Optional delete confirmation.
    * Composite fields.
    * Allow search result limits for LDAP backends.

Known issues:
    * Documentation is not completely updated yet.
