    <heading>Import/Export</heading>

    <para>This menu allows you to import to and export from your personal
    address book ("My Addressbook"). It supports both CSV (Comma Separated
    Variable), Outlook, and vCard formats, as well as some other popular
    formats. To import an address book, you need to have the address book
    information to import on your local machine (on which the web browser is
    running).  To do this, you'll need to first export the address book
    information from your current email client.</para>

    <para>If you use Outlook Express:</para>
    <para>1) Click on File > Export > Address Book</para>
    <para>2) Select 'Text File' (Comma Separated Values) in the 'Address
    Book Export Tool'.  Click 'Export'.</para>
    <para>3) In the 'Save exported files as' field, type in a name for your
    address book.  Click 'Next'.</para>
    <para>4) Put a checkmark in the box to the left of each of the fields
    that you wish to export.  Click 'Finish'.</para>
    <para>5) You should receive a message that states 'Address book export
    process has completed'.  Click 'OK'.</para>
    <para>6) Click 'Close' on the 'Address Book Export Tool' and close
    Outlook Express.</para>

    <para>If the exported address book file is not located on your desktop,
    and you're using a Windows operating system, click on Start > Find or
    Search > Files or Folders and search your main hard drive for the file
    name that you used in step 3.  Make note of the file's location.</para>

    <para>To import an address book, open the address book you want to
    import the information into. Click on the Import/Export Icon. Select the
    type of address information data file you want to import from the
    selection list.  Click on the browse button to open a file browser to
    navigate among the files on your computer in order to locate the address
    data file. Select the file, and click on the Import button. The
    information in the file will be imported into your address book. Some
    complex entries, or entries with fields that don't match Address Book's
    fields, may not import correctly, so you should verify the imported data
    after an import.</para>
