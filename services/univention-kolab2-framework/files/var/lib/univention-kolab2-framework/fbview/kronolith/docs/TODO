=====================================
|| Kronolith Development TODO List ||
=====================================

- Finish scripts/eventd to flexibly send reminders.

- Need a UI for deleting exceptions to a recurring event.

- A separate location to select the calendars to display in the
summary. Currently the summary displays what ever you had selected the
last time you were in Kronolith.

- The option to not have any personal calendars displayed, now with
remote calendars this would be a desirable option.

- Remove the assumption that each calendar is using the same
backend. Ideally it should be possible to have a local calendar using
sql or mcal and a remote calendar using another driver (eg wcap or
whatever mozilla uses).

- Drivers should handle the permissions checks instead of accessing
shares directly (outside drivers) to get the permissions for an event
or calendar. One day we might have a calendar backend that knows about
permissions.

- Allow publishing calendars to a remote site as iCalendar files.

- Allow direct access to calendars in iCalendar format (for working
directly with Mozilla Calendar, Apple's iCal, and similar programs as
a remote calendar server).

- Saving of individual events as .ics files.

- Support for searching a local file system for freebusy info.

- Support for searching freebusy.office.microsoft.com for freebusy
info.

- Automatically locate a meeting time.

- Add a quick tool for planning meeting agendas.

- Handle resource scheduling/management somehow, either per-calendar
or by kinds of calendars, including rules for when overlapping
appointments are allowed, etc.
