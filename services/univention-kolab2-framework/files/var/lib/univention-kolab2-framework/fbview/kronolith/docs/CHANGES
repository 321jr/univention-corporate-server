----
v2.0
----

[cjh] Add Kolab drivers (Stuart Bingë <s.binge@codefusion.co.za>).


----------
v2.0-ALPHA
----------

[cjh] Remote calendars are now parsed with the Horde_iCalendar library,
      which allows for much better iCalendar support, better handling of
      timezones, etc.
[cjh] The month view no longer shows blank boxes for days in the grid that are
      outside of the current month - instead, it goes back into the previous
      month and forward into the next month however many days are showable.
[cjh] Kronolith now includes the functionality, previously in Moment,
      to track attendees for events, send invitations, updates, and
      cancellations, and do scheduling based on freebusy information
      (Stuart Binge <s.binge@codefusion.co.za>).
[cjh] Kronolith_Driver::move() added to prevent event IDs changing when moving
      between calendars, if possible.
[cjh] GUIDs now only contain kronolith: and the event ID - sharename is not needed.
[cjh] Event IDs are now 32-character unique strings, to be useable as GUIDs.
      The SQL table definition has changed; conversion scripts are in scripts/.
[cjh] eventd now uses the Horde_Scheduler API's ability to serialize and
      save state; it's now meant to be run out of cron every minute (no
      more slow memory munching).
[cjh] Show start and end times in event tooltips
      (Payton <payton@repligen.com>).
[cjh] Fix events that recur every n months (where n != 1) on the same
      weekday when using the SQL driver.
[cjh] Track addition, modification, and deletion of events
      with the Horde History:: API.
[cjh] The event editor now switches the list of categories to match the
      calendar that you are adding the event to.
[cjh] Show tooltips with event descriptions.
[cjh] Show a legend mapping categories to colors
      (Jason Rust <jrust@rustyparts.com>).
[mir] listEvents now supports an option to NOT do recurrence (useful for
      synchronizing with other systems).
[cjh] First shot at a reminder daemon, written in PHP and using the
      Horde_Scheduler framework.
[cjh] Cache free/busy information for an hour.
[cjh] Add viewing of shared calendars side-by-side in the month view
      (j.huinink@wanadoo.nl).
[cjh] Kronolith now generates free/busy information for any calendar that the
      viewer has PERMS_SHOW permission to. This can be used in, e.g., Outlook
      for scheduling meetings, etc.
[cjh] Support for guest calendars.
[cjh] Use the global shares editing page for changing/assigning share permissions.
[mac] Add support for subscribing to remote iCalendar files.
[cjh] Remove the Share header for now; takes up far too much space
      to communicate limited information.
[mac] Add ability to display multiple calendars at a time.
[cjh] Palm DateBook (PDB) import support.
[mac] Add shared calendars support (Joel Vandal <jvandal@infoteck.qc.ca>).
[cjh] Kronolith can now send iCalendar invitations to an event.
[cjh] Import/Export of iCalendar data works for basic attributes now.
[cjh] Use Horde::compressOutput() for output compression.


------
v1.1.1
------

[jan] Fix some display bugs with recurring events in the sql driver (cjh).

----------

      <devteam@platinum-sy.net>).


----
v1.1
----

[cjh] Kronolith_Event objects now know how to obtain their driver,
      rather than storing a reference. Makes for much smaller/better
      return values over XML-RPC, at least.
[cjh] Fix a bug in the spanning algorithm when there were two
      independant sets of overlapping events that were not common
      factors (i.e, a set of 2 events and a set of 3 events). Also
      start to document the row spanning code.
[mir] Implement week of month recurrence for SQL driver.
[cjh] Use Kronolith::listEvents() everywhere, so there is only one body
      of code to debug/add to for listing of events.
[cjh] Show Nag tasks, if requested, on all views.
[cjh] Use Kronolith::listEvents() in the week views; should be much
      more efficient (fewer SQL queries/MCAL calls).

[cjh] Fix links to events on other calendars in the summary.
[cjh] Show category colors in the Kronolith summary.

------

[cjh] Allow all-day events and montly-on-weekday recurrence.
[cjh] Add a Horde summary API function.
[cjh] Use 24hr time preference (Jan Schneider <janmailing@gmx.de>).
[cjh] Added Preferences framework into Kronolith.
[jon] Merge doctype.inc into common-header.inc.
[jon] Allow the registry to handle Kronolith's configuration values.
[jon] HORDE_BASE is now defined in lib/base.php instead of config/conf.php.
[cjh] Define the HORDE_BASE constant in config/conf.php, and use it when
      referring to any of Horde's files.
[jon] Retired config/menu.txt in favor of config/menu.php.  This file follows
      a new format based on native PHP data structures.
[cjh] Add an optional keywords section, and a keywords definition file.
[cjh] Add a location field to events.

[cjh] Remove year.php; it's ugly and not really useful.
[cjh] Open the calender in base.php.
[cjh] Remove most of the remaining mcal-dependent code.
[cjh] Kronolith now uses Horde authentication instead of its own. This means
      that whatever auth method you are using for Horde will be used to
      authenticate to Kronolith, and in return you get single sign-on with any
      other apps using Horde authentication. This also means that Kronolith
      is completely independent of MCAL for authentication now; if you have
      one MCAL user, that's enough to provide calendars for all Horde users.
[cjh] Add lib/base.php to include all globally needed conf files and
      libraries, set up the language, etc.
[cjh] Abstract the event creation/edit code into the
      Kronolith_Driver/Kronolith_Event classes.
[cjh] Changes to work with register_globals = Off. (IN PROGRESS)
[cjh] Add an optional "get the time this event would start on day x" feature
      to the Kronolith_Event:: class, allowing status.php to work with
      recurring events.
[cjh] We now have the Kronolith_Event abstraction class that abstracts away
      details of events, so that the frontend scripts aren't dependant on
      mcal.
[cjh] Display events which are in progress, just starting, or start in under
      two hours along with other messages just under the menu.
[cjh] Much slicker UI.
[cjh] Use mcal_popen instead of mcal_open - might give us a performance gain.


------

------

[cjh] Don't display delete links in month view; slimmer UI.
[jon] Silence session_start warnings.
[jon] Use Horde::url() in place of the deprecated buildURL() function.
