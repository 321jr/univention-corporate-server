    This is the configuration file for a CAA Service Module and is parsed by CAAConfigLoader
    which attempts to load all the values into the system.

    Copy this file and name it something using the convention <service-name>-config.xml,
    make sure it goes in the webapps/caa/config directory, remove this comment and add your own
    service config (see below).

    Each service is in a tag of its own (e.g. <my-service> below).  There can be multiple services in this
    file if you wish.

    The following elements can be used:

        <disabled>          - set this to true to make this service unavailable to clients

    There are several "components" that can be configured:

        <transformer>       - specifies the CAATransformer implementation class (mandatory)
        <connection>        - specifies the CAAConnection implementation class (optional)
        <service>           - specifies the CAAService implementation class (mandatory)
        <session>           - specifies the CAASession implementation class (optional)
        <securityProvider>  - specifies the CAASecurityProvider implementation class (optional)

    All the mandatory component class files specified *must* exist in the classpath when the system is
    started.

    Each component can have further arbitrary configuration at the <class> level or by specifying
    delegate configuration to another class using a <configurator> element.  This element can contain:

        <class>             - specifies the CAAConfigurable implementation class (mandatory) that
                              will be delegated to handle configuration for this component. The framework
                              will call readConfig()on this class.                              
        <params>            - an element containing arbitrary parameters to pass to the class specified
                              in <class>.  This can be any valid XML and as long as the delegate can
                              handle it OK, you should be OK.

    Further help on how to implement the interfaces mentioned above can be found in the main
    CAA Developer's Guide.

    Enjoy!
