    This is the configuration file for the CAA framework and may contain defaults for framework services.
    These defaults can be overridden by service modules using service-specific config files
    (see sample-service-config.xml)

    The root element must be <service> and there must be a maximum of one.  If this doesn't exist,
    that's OK, the system will revert to hard-coded defaults.

    Nested within the <service> element there can be several elements representing the various
    "framework components" (all optional) such as but not limited to:

        <sessionManager>       - configures the CAASessionManager
        <connectionManager>    - configures the CAAConnectionManager
        <securityManager>      - configures the CAASecurityManager

  Each component, if specified must have a nested:

        <class>                - specifies the CAAConfigurable class that will be delegated to handle
                                 configuration for this component.  The framework will call readConfig()
                                 on this class.

        <params>               - an (optional) element containing arbitrary parameters to pass to
                                 the class specified in <class>.  This can be any valid XML and as long as
                                 the delegate canhandle it OK, you should be OK.

  Further help on how to implement the interfaces mentioned above can be found in the main
  CAA Developer's Guide.

  Enjoy!
